According to local authorities, Saru was attacked on January 7 in the Gerbani area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Rawat was killed by a tiger on January 10 in Kalimati Rural Municipality-7, which shares a border with Gerbani. Khaptadi was attacked and died on January 13 as he had been at a local ghatta (traditional water-powered grinding mill). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DSP Hem Bahadur KC at the District Police Office, Salyan, said that parts of Kalimati Rural Municipality and the neighbouring areas of Surkhet are close to Banke and Bardiya National Parks. \u201cPeople who go into nearby forest areas to collect fodder and firewood are at higher risk of wild animal attacks, including tigers,\u201d he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the deaths, fear has gripped the local communities. Kalimati-7 ward chair Mitralal Rijal said residents are terrorised after the series of fatal attacks within a short period. In addition to human casualties, the tiger also killed two domesticated animals, further increasing concern among locals, it is said.</p>\n",

Over 170 films will be showcased. These films have been selected from over 800 submissions worldwide, based on their relevance to Nepal\u2019s social context and contemporary issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These films highlight the lived experiences and social and political realities of queer individuals across the globe. The objective of the festival is to promote solidarity with and respect for people whose sexual identities differ from socially prescribed gender norms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the context of Nepal, mainstream cinema and film festivals have not given sufficient space to gender diversity and queer films. That is why, as an alternative platform like Queer Film Festival Kathmandu was needed,\u201d said Jyotsna Maskey, co-director of Queer Film Festival Kathmandu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with raising issues of diversity, sexuality, and gender identity in cinema, the festival also works to reduce the distance between the queer community and the general audience who want to understand them better. The organising committee stated that this festival is necessary to contribute to building a society where everyone belongs and feels belonged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film festival will run until 24 January and will be screened at Airawat Picture House (Microcinema Auditorium). Feeling the need for an alternate space to screen films, Docskool, the organiser of the Queer Film Festival Kathmand,u has opened the space with this film festival.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood films are made in Nepal. They have gone to and been screened at prestigious international film festivals. But when those same films try to find screening space in Nepal, they don\u2019t get venues,&#8221; said Kshitiz Adhiraj, co-director of Queer Film Festival Kathmandu and Founder Director of Docskool. &#8220;We opened this microcinema theatre to ensure such films are shown to Nepali audiences in Nepal, and with this year\u2019s Queer Festival Kathmandu, we have brought this auditorium into use,\u201d</p>\n",

I am writing this letter to you not only as a concerned young Nepali but also as someone whose words and leadership have inspired me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I would like to sincerely congratulate you on being appointed as the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/gagan-thapa-nepali-congress-president.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/gagan-thapa-nepali-congress-president.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">President of the Nepali Congress </a>through the Special Convention. This is a significant responsibility, and for many young people like me, seeing you take on this role has restored a sense of hope and awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write this with the utmost honesty. For a long time, trust in politics has been fading among the youth. Yet your appointment has reminded many of us why we believed in leadership in the first place. You have been one of the very few leaders who consistently considered the voice of young people and showed accountability toward what the country is going through. That recognition matters deeply to a generation that often feels ignored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am writing this letter from the bottom of my heart, not as a politician or expert, but as someone who once believed deeply in the future you spoke about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still remember when you visited LRI School years ago. I was just a student then, but your words stayed with me. You spoke about trusting young people, about accountability, and about building a Nepal that could become one of South Asia\u2019s truly developed nations. At that age, those ideas felt powerful and real. For many of us, you represented hope and possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gagan-Thapa-cover-1024x500-1.jpg\" alt=\"Special convention elects Gagan Thapa as Nepali Congress President\" class=\"wp-image-577846\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, five or six years later, things feel very different. After what many call a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-Nepalese-Gen-Z-Protests\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-Nepalese-Gen-Z-Protests\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gen-Z awakening</a>, trust in politics has fallen drastically. Corruption, greed, and repeated disappointments have pushed many young people into frustration and silence. Some have stopped believing in the political leaders entirely. Others have chosen to leave the country, not because they want to, but because they feel unheard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you are aware of this reality. I believe you see the anger, the exhaustion, and the loss of trust among the youth. That is why I am writing to you. Not to accuse, but to remind you of the words you once spoke to students like me, and of the responsibility that comes with the trust you inspired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal does not lack talented or hardworking young people. What we lack is faith that integrity still matters in leadership. Many of us are still waiting for leaders who will choose principle over power and long-term change over short-term gain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you continue to stand for what you once promised us. I hope you continue to listen, not just to party voices, but to the quiet disappointment of young Nepalis who still want to believe. Despite the frustrations caused by corruption and repeated political failures, the youth of Nepal have shown time and again that they care deeply about their country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our trust may have been shaken, but it is not completely gone. With leaders like you who take youth seriously and act with integrity, there is hope that this generation can help shape a Nepal that reflects the values we have long dreamed of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I write it with honesty, concern, and hope for a better Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respectfully,<br>Dipanshu Joshi</p>\n",

Compared to the first quarter of FY 2024/25, the economy in the current fiscal year is projected to grow by 3.02 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the NSO\u2019s analysis, the growth rate in the first quarter remained modest due to a contraction in the production of food crops, forest products, non-life insurance, construction materials for domestic production, and other sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, growth in electricity generation and distribution, financial activities, livestock production, fruits and vegetables, trade services, and tourist arrivals supported overall economic expansion, the office said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NSO noted that all 18 industrial sectors included in the calculation of the economy posted positive expansion during this quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, based on seasonally adjusted data, when comparing gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, the economy contracted by 1.68 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the 18 industrial sectors, 13 recorded negative growth during this quarter, which had an impact on the overall economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Electricity and gas drive growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among industrial sectors, activities related to electricity and gas recorded the highest value addition in the first quarter, with a growth rate of 14.91 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was followed by financial and insurance activities, which grew by 7.07 percent, and professional, scientific and technical activities, which expanded by 5.52 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agriculture, the largest contributor to the economy, recorded a growth rate of just 1.36 percent. The lower growth in agriculture is attributed to an estimated decline in paddy production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the office reported increased production in livestock, vegetables and fruits. Wholesale and retail trade, the second-largest contributor to the economy, is estimated to grow by 3.89 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sector remained positive due to growth in domestic production and imports of trade-related goods. The lowest growth rate during the quarter was recorded in water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities, at 1.11 percent, followed by human health and social work activities at 1.19 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the final quarter of the previous fiscal year, mining and quarrying, public administration and defence, and social security recorded the highest negative growth rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, electricity and gas, information and communication, and professional, scientific and technical services are estimated to have recorded higher growth. Agriculture, the largest contributor to the economy, contracted by 1.65 percent during this period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gen Z movement took place during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

While construction expanded by 3.26 percent, the industrial sector recorded growth of only 1.52 percent.</p>\n",

Nepal has been included in the list, raising concerns among those seeking permanent residency in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Al Jazeera, the decision does not apply to tourist, short-term, business or other non-immigrant visas. Applicants from affected countries may continue to submit immigrant visa applications, but no approvals or issuances will be granted during the suspension period. The US government has not set a timeline for lifting the measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US State Department has instructed consular officials to halt decisions on immigrant visa applications from the listed countries. The department said the move follows a broader review aimed at preventing potential immigrants who may rely on public welfare benefits from entering the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dual nationals will not be affected if they apply using a valid passport from a non-suspended country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision comes amid a series of stricter immigration measures under the Trump administration, including travel bans, reduced refugee quotas and higher fees for skilled worker visas. Analysts say the suspension raises questions about the US approach to immigrants and long-term migration policy.</p>\n",

Magars residing in the Kathmandu Valley took out the cultural procession on Thursday, marching from Bhrikutimandap to Tundikhel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maghe Sankranti is regarded as a special festival among the Magar community, particularly one that honours daughters and sisters. On this day, rituals are performed to worship clan deities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to tradition, on the morning of Maghe Sankranti, brothers bathe and, after fasting, worship their lineage deities and ancestors. They then apply tika to their sisters and present gifts along with offerings of cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Magar community, the gift\u2014prepared by combining yams, fruits, sel roti, vegetables and other food items\u2014is known as <em>Mishra</em> or <em>Nisro</em>, meaning a gift or prasad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intending to have the indigenous cultures of the Magar community listed in the Government of Nepal\u2019s national inventory and promote them globally, the Magar Association has also organised an Indigenous Cultural National Festival at Tundikhel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

Consuming yam, ghee, <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/the-story-behind-chaku-a-sugary-treat-to-mark-winters-end.html\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"428678\">chaku</a>, and sesame laddu are parts of the rituals of this festival. Yams are generally boiled one day in advance before the Sankranti (the first day of Magh month), on the last day of Poush and eaten on the Sankranti day. This practice is in accordance with the old Nepali sayings \u2018Poushko pakya, Maghma khanya\u2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the cultural connotation of yams among Nepalis, this ground vegetable has an abundance of medicinal benefits. Yam is a herbaceous vine producing tuber crop belonging to the family &#8216;Dioscoreaceae&#8217; and genus &#8216;Dioscorea&#8217;. There are hundreds of species of yams with varieties of colours and sizes in the world. And, among them, ghartarul (cultivated yam) and bantarul (wild yam) are the most popular ones in Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enriched in many <a href=\"https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170072/nutrients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nutrients and minerals </a>like carbohydrates, protein, dietary fibre, potassium, vitamin B1, B6 and C, manganese, and many more, yam or tarul has many health benefits. Here are some of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Improve digestion</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/belly-stomach-digestion-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-460790\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/belly-stomach-digestion-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/belly-stomach-digestion-300x225.jpg 300w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/belly-stomach-digestion-768x576.jpg 768w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/belly-stomach-digestion-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/belly-stomach-digestion-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo: Byrdie</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is believed that consuming yams may help in improving digestion. A <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31025041/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a> confirms that the resistant starch found in yams \u201ccould ameliorate lipid metabolism in association with gut microbiota modulation, which could provide references for further medication.\u201d Resistant starch feeds the good bacteria in the gut and also increases the digestive enzymes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, resistant starches found in yam have the potential to alleviate many digestive ailments like inflammation, constipation, and diarrhoea, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Fight cancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"651\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cancer-1024x651.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-369200\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cancer-1024x651.jpg 1024w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cancer-300x191.jpg 300w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cancer-768x488.jpg 768w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cancer-175x110.jpg 175w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cancer.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Taruls contain antioxidants properties that can help prevent cancer.&nbsp; In a study conducted in rats, it was concluded that the yam can enhance the antioxidant defence system and modulate inflammatory mediators that ultimately lead to the reduction of colon tumour growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, yams are rich in vitamin C that protects the body from cancer-causing harmful radicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.

In an animal <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21598421/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study</a>, it was concluded that diosgenin found in taruls boosted the memory power and learning abilities in mice in the Morris water maze test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Keep the heart healthy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"732\" height=\"549\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heart-healthline.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-460791\" style=\"width:580px;height:435px\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heart-healthline.jpg 732w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heart-healthline-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo: Healthline</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Taruls can help keep the heart healthy by improving blood sugar levels and lowering cholesterol levels. In a study done on rats, they were given modified water yam flour (MWYF) as a supplement for four weeks. And, it was found that all MWYF showed the ability to decrease blood glucose levels in the rats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16093400/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another study</a>, it was found that women who consumed 390 grams of yams daily for one month exhibited a 6 per cent drop in cholesterol levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Help in weight loss</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/weight-loss-webmd-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-460792\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/weight-loss-webmd-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/weight-loss-webmd-300x200.jpg 300w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/weight-loss-webmd-768x512.jpg 768w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/weight-loss-webmd-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/weight-loss-webmd.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo: WebMD</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As taruls are full of dietary fibres, they can lower your food intake. Also, taruls keep one full for a longer time. Also, they are low in calories as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.sciencedomain.org/abstract/1514\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">animal study</a>, it was found that yam extract \u2018significantly reduced food intake, fasting blood glucose level, and body weight.\u2019 There, dietary fibres in taruls can aid in losing weight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Originally published on January 14, 2021</strong></p>\n",

Since his leadership emerged from a revolt against the Deuba faction, the special convention elected Thapa as president unanimously.</p>\n",

Thapa and Sharma had announced the convention, citing demands from 54 percent of the party\u2019s general convention representatives, claiming the leadership had ignored their call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a Central Working Committee meeting, attended by both Thapa and Sharma, had earlier agreed to hold the party\u2019s regular general convention in April if it could not be organised in January. The two general secretaries had expressed dissent over that decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insisting that the decision of the closed session hall would be final, Thapa and Sharma proceeded to form an election committee and moved ahead with the electoral process to convene the special convention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to prevent a party split, leaders held discussions in several phases. On Tuesday alone, talks were held in three rounds. Earlier this morning, the two general secretaries also met party president Sher Bahadur Deuba, but the discussion failed to produce a breakthrough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the deadlock, the faction backing the special convention instructed the election committee to proceed with disciplinary action. Accordingly, Gagan Thapa\u2019s name has been registered as a candidate for the party presidency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The election committee has said that nominations for other office-bearer positions have also been filed.</p>\n",

Nepal, which had never progressed beyond the Asia stage in women\u2019s cricket history, secured a place in the <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/women-s-t20-world-cup-qualifier-2025-26-1515205/match-schedule-fixtures-and-results\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/women-s-t20-world-cup-qualifier-2025-26-1515205/match-schedule-fixtures-and-results\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Global Qualifiers</a>, creating a wave of optimism and excitement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team, which consists of an effective blend of experienced players like Rubina Chhetri and Indu Barma alongside promising youngsters, not only earned a chance to script another historic chapter for Nepal, but also prepared itself for the challenge of facing stronger, more established teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veteran player Sita Rana Magar, the most senior member of the squad who had missed the previous Asia qualifiers, has returned to the team for the Global Qualifiers. Her comeback is anticipated to add further energy and balance to the side. With young players in good form and the advantage of home conditions, the Nepali women\u2019s team now embarks on a journey to make yet another piece of history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Nepal\u2019s U-19 women\u2019s team having already featured in a World Cup, a certain level of pressure also mounts on the senior side to match that achievement. Pooja Mahato, who captained Nepal at the U-19 Women\u2019s World Cup, is also part of the senior team\u2019s World Cup journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Global Qualifiers, beginning next week, represent the final step toward the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. The top four teams from this tournament will earn direct qualification for the World Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal has already announced its final 15-member squad for the tournament, with Indu Barma leading the side as captain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having reached the Global Qualifiers for the first time after clearing the Asia stage, Nepal now sets its sights on qualifying for the World Cup for the very first time. However, the road ahead will not be easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the group stage, Nepal will face higher-ranked teams, some of whom have already played in previous World Cups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s primary objective is to qualify for the World Cup. The team has been preparing for this challenge for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain Indu Barma believes that every opponent will be strong and that victory will depend on performance on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAll the opposing teams are strong. What matters is how we perform on match day. We have to give our best,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New coach, renewed energy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1250\" height=\"694\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/harshal-pathak-1.png\" alt=\"Harshal Jayant Pathak \" class=\"wp-image-577836\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the qualifiers, <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/harshal-jayant-pathak-head-coach.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/harshal-jayant-pathak-head-coach.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harshal Jayant Pathak</a> was appointed as the head coach of the Nepali women\u2019s team. Pathak previously coached the Thailand women\u2019s team, guiding them to their first-ever appearance at the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathak\u2019s goal will be to help Nepal achieve the same milestone. He has already expressed optimism about Nepal\u2019s chances of qualifying for the World Cup. The players, too, appear motivated under his guidance. Captain Indu Barma described his appointment as a positive development for the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHis appointment is a very good thing for us. Ultimately, we are the ones who play, but working on our skills under his guidance adds some plus points,\u201d Indu says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vice-captain Pooja Mahato also expressed confidence that Pathak could take Nepal to the World Cup, just as he did with Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can history be made again?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1152\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/612428154_1339544661535244_3227961692927933196_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577832\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By clearing the Asia Qualifiers, the Nepali women\u2019s team opened a new chapter in its cricketing journey. Now, the challenge is to move into the next chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Nepal progresses from the group stage of the Global Qualifiers to the Super Six, and then finishes among the top four, the senior women\u2019s team will qualify for the World Cup for the first time. This would be the biggest achievement in the history of Nepali women\u2019s cricket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do so, Nepal must overcome challenges from Test-playing nations and teams that have already featured in the World Cup. Advancing beyond the group stage will require Nepal to play better cricket than it has so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s first-ever women\u2019s team captain, Neri Thapa, believes the current squad is performing well and is a genuine contender for World Cup qualification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEven though we didn\u2019t get the opportunity, this team has. They are performing well. If they can perform even better, they can reach the World Cup,\u201d Thapa says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Teams that reach the World Cup qualifiers are strong. Compared to previous tournaments, this one will require even more hard work.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal also has the chance to create history on home soil. Thapa said playing at home is a fortunate opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja Mahato, who captained the U-19 team at the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, is now the vice-captain of the senior side. Her World Cup experience, along with her individual ability, will be crucial in the upcoming tournament.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Batting shows promise, bowling still a concern</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nepali team has been training for some time ahead of the home-based Global Qualifiers. After starting with fitness-focused sessions, the team worked extensively on batting, bowling, and fielding, and also played practice matches against several teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performances in practice matches suggest improvement in Nepal\u2019s batting, something the team must carry into the main tournament.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal played two practice matches against the United States and one against Scotland, showing strong batting performances in all three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal chased down a target of 139 against the USA in the first practice match. Against Scotland, while chasing 184, Nepal scored 156. In another practice match against the USA, Nepal successfully chased 157.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former captain and senior player Rubina Chhetri said the batting unit now feels more comfortable than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt feels a bit easier compared to earlier. We are trying to improve, but we still need to do even better,\u201d Chhetri says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Nepal has also conceded runs, and despite visible improvement in fielding, further progress is needed. Former captain Thapa also pointed out the need to strengthen bowling and fielding alongside batting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur batters perform well, but there is a bit of a gap in bowling, and fielding can be slow at times. We need to focus on that,\u201d Thapa said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inspiration for the next generation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s U-19 women\u2019s team played in the World Cup last year, and now the senior team stands at the final step toward achieving the same feat. Crossing this hurdle would be a landmark achievement for women\u2019s cricket in Nepal and a major source of inspiration for future generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal is also set to co-host the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup in 2027. Former captain Thapa believes such milestones will strongly motivate young players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is a big difference between our time and now. Earlier, we played U-19 and senior cricket too, and it was good,\u201d she says. \u201cNow the U-19 team is playing the World Cup. Playing at home gives Nepal an added advantage, and it\u2019s a happy thing that there are more achievements now than before.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She further adds, &#8220;It motivates the next generation. When such a big event is happening in Nepal, it makes new players happy too. Having these kinds of tournaments on home grounds is a good thing.&#8221;</p>\n",

Trekkers and mountaineers head to Lukla, pilgrims fly to Lumbini, and tourists explore Pokhara and other scenic destinations across the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>International visitors arrive through Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, the main gateway to Nepal. For many passengers, this means pre-booked flights, occasional delays, and crowded airports. But behind the scenes, something far more important is happening\u2014within a small airspace, a quiet and constant effort ensures that every flight operates safely and that more aircraft can be accommodated within the same sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the unseen story of the guardians behind the curtain, and how Nepal keeps aviation safe during the tourist rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A small sky with big demands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Nepal\u2019s greatest attractions, its geography, also poses its biggest challenge for aviation. Towering mountains, deep valleys, rapidly changing weather, and closely located airports all exist within a relatively small airspace. Unlike larger countries with multiple parallel routes and wide-open skies, Nepal must manage high traffic density in constrained conditions where routes are closer, intersecting, and surrounded by hills and mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During peak tourist seasons, the number of flights increases significantly, especially on domestic mountain routes and international services. Since the sky does not expand and runways do not multiply overnight, pressure on the existing system increases. However, safety cannot be compromised, regardless of the number of flights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety before speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During peak season, one of the most common questions passengers ask is, \u201cThe weather looks fine\u2014so why is my flight delayed?\u201d Frustration grows, questions are raised about management and systems, and complaints appear on online platforms. But the answer lies in aviation\u2019s most important principle: safety always comes before speed, convenience, and the number of flights completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the number of aircraft increases, air traffic controllers must carefully manage aircraft spacing in the air, runway availability on the ground, weather changes along mountain routes, and operations at challenging airports like Lukla, where conditions can change rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coordination between different airports and airspace sectors also becomes critical. At times, slowing things down, such as increasing time intervals between departures, is the safest option. Delays are not always signs of inefficiency; they are often deliberate risk-management measures that reduce congestion and ensure each aircraft has sufficient space to operate safely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of air traffic controllers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Air traffic controllers (ATCs) are often called the \u201cguardians of the sky behind the curtain.\u201d During tourist rush periods, their role becomes even more critical. From control towers, approach control units, and area control centres, ATCs continuously monitor aircraft movements, maintain safe separation, manage arrivals and departures during busy hours, reroute aircraft when weather changes suddenly, and coordinate with pilots, airports, and neighbouring airspaces to ensure safety at every moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pilots are responsible for the safe operation of their aircraft, ATCs guide those aircraft from the moment they leave the ground until they touch down again. They carry the responsibility of hundreds of lives every day. Their objective is simple yet demanding: every aircraft must depart and land safely, no matter how crowded the sky becomes. This requires constant focus, teamwork, coordination, and strong decision-making under pressure, especially when multiple flights compete for the same routes or runways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Managing weather in the mountains</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Nepal, the weather is not just a background condition; it is a decisive factor. Due to the country\u2019s uneven topography, weather patterns can change quickly and unpredictably. At most mountainous airports, clouds can build rapidly, winds can shift unexpectedly, and visibility can drop within minutes, requiring immediate changes to previously agreed plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During peak season, when flights are scheduled close together, managing operations around weather becomes even more critical. Controllers and pilots rely on real-time observations, forecasts, and experience to decide whether to allow a flight to proceed, hold it on the ground, or delay or divert it for safety. These decisions are never taken lightly. They are made to ensure that increased tourism does not translate into increased risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One runway, many flights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tribhuvan International Airport, Nepal\u2019s primary international gateway, operates with a single runway that serves both international and domestic flights. During peak tourist hours, this runway becomes one of the busiest pieces of infrastructure in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing international wide-body arrivals, domestic mountain flights, helicopter operations, and emergency or priority movements requires precise timing and close coordination. Every takeoff and landing is carefully planned. Even minor disruptions can affect multiple flights, which is why controllers often take preventive action early\u2014accepting small delays to avoid larger disruptions later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety systems behind the scenes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern aviation safety does not rely solely on individual skill. Nepal\u2019s aviation system follows international standards set by the<a href=\"https://www.icao.int/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> International Civil Aviation Organization </a>(ICAO). These include state safety programmes, safety management systems, continuous monitoring and reporting, and rigorous training and certification of aviation professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During peak tourist seasons, these systems help identify potential risks related to traffic volume, staffing, weather patterns, or infrastructure, and address them before they lead to incidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why passenger patience matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For travellers eager to begin their holiday or return home, delays can be frustrating. However, understanding the reasons behind them can change perceptions of Nepal\u2019s aviation system. Every delay caused by traffic management, weather assessment, or safety checks is a decision made in the best interest of passengers\u2014to ensure a safe journey and avoid airborne holding or diversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aviation history and accident investigation reports worldwide show that accidents are more likely when systems are rushed or safety margins are reduced. Nepal\u2019s approach during the tourist rush is clear: it is better to arrive late than not arrive safely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking ahead: Growing tourism, smarter skies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s natural beauty, stunning landscapes, and diverse destinations continue to attract both domestic and international tourists. With improved road and air connectivity and growing interest in reaching even the most remote areas, tourism is expected to keep rising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This growth demands smarter airspace management, improved infrastructure, advanced navigation procedures, and continued investment in people and technology. The goal is not just to handle more flights, but to do so without compromising safety\u2014a responsibility shared by aviation authorities, airlines, airport operators, and the professionals working quietly behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When tourist seasons fill Nepal\u2019s skies with more aircraft, safety is ensured not by luck, but by planning, professionalism, and patience. The sky may remain the same size, but the effort to keep it safe grows with every additional flight. While passengers may only see delay notices at airports, a dedicated system is constantly at work to ensure that Nepal remains not only a beautiful destination, but also a safe one to fly into and out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in aviation, especially during the tourist rush, safety is the journey\u2019s most important destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

What I witnessed there troubled me deeply. The Early Childhood Development classrooms sat nearly empty. A school that once buzzed with hundreds of students now struggles with alarmingly low enrollment at the ECD and primary levels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of children has gone down due to migration to urban areas. Among those who remain in the village, most have moved to private schools, their parents choosing to pay fees rather than accept free government services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then my friend told me about Singh Jaleshwari Basic School in Khesang, another neighbouring primary school. The situation there is even more stark. The school has shrunk from Grade 7 down to Grade 5. Student numbers have dwindled to just 33.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t about two struggling schools. It&#8217;s the story of rural government schools across Nepal. And it reveals a crisis far deeper than empty classrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The ECD paradox: Built but empty</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"712\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bhojpur.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577793\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in rural Nepal in the late 1975&#8217;s, a time when Early Childhood Education was not available in villages. I began Grade 1 without much preparation, finding it difficult to hold a pencil or follow instructions. Despite these early struggles, I was able to succeed in my education and career, even though ECD in Nepal did not begin until the 1950s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the situation has changed dramatically. Nepal now has Early Childhood Development centres operating across the country. Government schools offer free education, free textbooks, and midday meals. Yet classrooms sit empty or nearly so. Schools that once served 200-300 students now struggle with 50-100 in ECD through Grade 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern is clear and devastating: first, families migrate to cities, taking their children with them. Then, among the families who remain, parents increasingly choose private schools over free government services. This double exodus reveals something more troubling than empty classrooms: it reveals a complete collapse of trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The migration wound</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rural-to-urban migration is the most overlooked factor driving this crisis. Educated families and those with even modest means are leaving for cities, creating a devastating double blow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, these migrating families often provided leadership in School Management Committees. Without them, committees become inactive, meetings turn into formalities, and schools drift without accountability. Second, their children no longer attend these schools either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a brutal cycle. Government schools lose students to urban migration first, then lose more as remaining families choose private alternatives. What&#8217;s left is socioeconomic segregation: government schools increasingly serve only low-income families who have neither the means to migrate nor the money for private school fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why private schools win (Even when they shouldn&#8217;t)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the uncomfortable truth: in Arun and similar areas, private schools with rented buildings, no playgrounds, and minimally trained teachers still attract parents. The reason? Children &#8220;speak English from day one,&#8221; and schools &#8220;project discipline.&#8221; Government ECD centres are seen as slow and uncertain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This raises a critical question: why do municipalities license new private schools when government schools are losing students? Political pressure, demand for English-medium education, and belief in &#8220;healthy competition&#8221; drive these decisions. But dividing a shrinking student population ensures neither system can operate effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The teacher&#8217;s credibility crisis</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most damaging reality of all: most teachers&#8217; own children don&#8217;t attend the government schools where they teach. They&#8217;re enrolled in private schools in nearby towns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents notice this. The unspoken message is devastating: &#8220;Even teachers don&#8217;t trust this system.&#8221; When teachers choose private schools for their children, it erodes their moral authority completely. How committed can teachers be when their own children study elsewhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The poverty trap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As migration and private enrollment draw away advantaged families, government schools serve increasingly marginalised communities. The parents who remain face unique challenges: working multiple jobs, migrating for seasonal labour, and struggling with basic survival. Limited education makes them hesitant to interact with teachers. Time poverty means no flexibility for school visits. Poverty creates psychological distance, a feeling that they &#8220;don&#8217;t belong&#8221; in school spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This disengagement isn&#8217;t apathy. It&#8217;s exhaustion. Teachers see it as indifference and decrease their efforts. Parents see this decreased effort as neglect. The cycle reinforces itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When free isn&#8217;t enough</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government highlights free education, textbooks, and midday meals. These matters, especially important for low-income families. But parents are clear: &#8220;We&#8217;re not only feeding our children, but we&#8217;re shaping their future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents will pay for private schools if they believe their child will learn, gain confidence, and not fall behind. Free services without visible quality don&#8217;t build trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The investment problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If government schools cannot maintain adequate enrollment at ECD and primary levels, all investments risk becoming wasteful. The infrastructure built for 200 students serves 50. Teachers teach classes of 5-8 children. Midday meal systems operate inefficiently. Training improves teachers, but they face tiny, disengaged classrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The return on investment diminishes dramatically when schools operate far below capacity. Yet this is increasingly the reality across rural Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What must change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Revitalising rural government schools requires action on multiple fronts. Local governments must create incentives for educated families to stay and participate in School Management Committees. Regulate private school expansion based on actual village needs rather than allowing unlimited growth. Make government schools transparent through regular parent-teacher meetings and clear progress reports showing real learning outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Address the &#8220;English anxiety&#8221; by hiring teachers who can introduce basic oral English early while maintaining strong mother tongue foundations. Provide teachers with locality-based incentives to keep quality educators in rural postings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most transformatively, create locally-managed Child Development Funds. When household budgets are tight, the promise of free nutritious daily meals and quality learning materials becomes powerful. If government ECD centres can provide better facilities and consistent meals through transparently managed funds, they become the most attractive option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The choice ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Standing at Shree Sharada School, seeing those empty ECD classrooms, and learning about Singh Jaleshwari Basic School in Khesang with just 33 remaining students, I understood that these aren&#8217;t isolated cases. They represent a systemic failure happening across rural Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents aren&#8217;t rejecting public education because it&#8217;s public. They&#8217;re rejecting it because they&#8217;re uncertain it will prepare their children for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without urgent reform, the migration-driven hollowing out of rural schools will accelerate, creating an educational landscape where public schools serve only low-income, least engaged families while wasting substantial investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question isn&#8217;t whether rural communities want quality education. They desperately do. The question is whether Nepal&#8217;s educational system can evolve fast enough to meet expectations before public education in rural areas disappears entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future depends not only on free services but on trust restored, communities stabilised, and investments protected through sustained enrollment. Those 33 children at Singh Jaleshwari deserve more. The nearly empty classrooms at Shree Sharada deserve to be filled again. But that will only happen when we address the fundamental crisis of trust that has driven families away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

As a result, imports from Taklakot have also stopped, Jaisi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no trading activity taking place, staff were moved to the contact office in Simkot instead of remaining stationed at Hilsa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaisi said the Chinese side of the border remains open. According to him, the Yari border customs office is expected to resume operations in the second week of Chaitra, when staff return to the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that since last Shrawan, the Yari border customs office has collected Rs 1.865 million in revenue, doubling the amount collected during the same period last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The programme was held at the university\u2019s School of Management premises in Lalitpur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was attended by Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Achyut Wagle, Registrar Prof Dr Rajiv Shrestha, deans of various faculties, and more than a dozen professors from different countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interaction was organised to facilitate the exchange of experiences among international professors teaching at the university. During the programme, participating professors shared their experiences of living and teaching in Nepal, the academic environment, students\u2019 curiosity, and aspects of intercultural learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at the programme, Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Wagle said the university has adopted a clear policy to encourage international professors. Expressing confidence that international academic practices and experiences would strengthen teaching and learning at the university, he also reaffirmed the institution\u2019s commitment to appointing more international professors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the programme, Thomas Doctor, Head of the university\u2019s Buddhist Studies Programme, noted that global interest in studying Buddhist traditions in Nepal is on the rise. He said the international nature of such programmes has created further opportunities in this field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than a dozen international professors participated in the programme. Currently, Kathmandu University has around two dozen international professors teaching across various disciplines. In line with its policy of appointing international faculty members, the university recently invited applications from international professors. According to the university, around 400 applications were received, and the appointment process is being advanced by different schools based on need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In line with its policy of providing quality higher education through international collaboration, Kathmandu University has so far signed cooperation agreements with 300 academic institutions. International students make up 12 percent of the university\u2019s total graduates.</p>\n",

But in recent years, the availability of milk has increased due to its commercial production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Around 60,000-70,000 farmers have engaged in milk production in Sudurpaschim Province, and 10,000-12,000 people have directly got employment from this business,&#8221; he added. According to the Ministry, one million cows and 500,000 buffaloes are being reared in nine districts of the province as well, and 355,000 metric tonnes of milk are being produced annually. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, there should be availability of 92 litres of milk per person annually in Nepal, the average availability of milk is 90 litres. Sudurpaschim province is in the lead in milk consumption, and most of the families have a trend of making ghee, yoghurt and other items, mentioned Shah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He expressed the belief that it will help in the economic transformation of the province if the dairy products could be promoted, linking with local taste and culture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The program has been introduced to link Nepal\u2019s film sector with formal academic education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program was formally announced on January 12 at an event held under the chief guestship of senior film director Yadav Kharel. Under the initiative, film studies will be institutionalised at the master\u2019s level, and the Film Development Board will provide scholarships to enrolled students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Nirmal Mani Adhikari, Head of the Department of Language and Mass Communication under KU\u2019s School of Arts, the two-year (66-credit) program will begin this February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the program aims to establish film not merely as a form of entertainment but as a serious academic, theoretical, and research-oriented discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film studies program will include courses on film theory, history, aesthetics, cultural studies, filmmaking, screenwriting, cinematography, sound design, editing, acting, film criticism, research, and contemporary subjects related to cinema, including artificial intelligence (AI).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the university and the Board expect the program to provide students with practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at the event, Film Development Board Chairperson Dinesh DC said the Board has partnered with KU to develop cinema as an academic and research-oriented field rather than limiting it to entertainment alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also announced that the Board will provide scholarships to encourage film students. The Board has been working with Tribhuvan University and other institutions to bring film studies into the formal academic stream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Board, such programs will help produce skilled human resources, promote research, and lay the foundation for making the Nepali film industry internationally competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Thapa, who lived in Prasiddha Tole, Lalitpur Metropolitan City\u201317, went missing around 2 pm on Poush 26. After he disappeared, his relatives searched the neighbourhood throughout the afternoon but were unable to locate him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Thapa remained missing, his family filed a complaint at the Satdobato Police Circle at around 7 pm. Two days after the complaint was lodged, police were able to trace his whereabouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time he went missing, Thapa, who was about four feet tall with a fair complexion, was wearing a black jacket with \u201cThe North Face\u201d written on it, black jeans, black shoes, and a cream-colored cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For two days, no information emerged about the elderly man, who lived about 800 meters northeast of the Satdobato Police Circle. However, on the third day, his body was found dumped after being murdered, according to SSP Hobindra Bogati of the Lalitpur District Police Range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large, suspicious white sack was spotted inside a well near Thapa\u2019s residence. On Monday, police retrieved the sack from the well and confirmed that it contained the body of Garjaman Thapa, who had gone missing on Poush 26, SSP Bogati said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After finding the body packed in a sack and dumped in a well, preliminary investigations confirmed that Thapa had been murdered. Police, concluding it was a homicide, have arrested one person on murder charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main suspect arrested is 23-year-old Saddham Mansur, a resident of East Champaran (Motihari), Bihar, India. A joint team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office, Lalitpur, and the Lalitpur District Police Range arrested him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police also arrested Yusuf Ansari and Mohammad Noman in connection with the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The elderly man lived near the factory where Mansur worked. As Thapa regularly visited the factory, the two were acquainted. Police said Thapa had gone to the factory on Poush 26 as usual, and Mansur allegedly killed him on that occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the murder, the victim\u2019s hands and legs were tied, his body was packed in a sack, and dumped into a well. Police have also recovered the stolen gold ring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Murder for the ring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to family members, Thapa used to wear a three-tola gold ring. Police investigations into Mansur also confirmed that the murder was committed to steal the ring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt appears the murder was carried out to rob the ring,\u201d a police investigation officer said. Mansur allegedly took the ring after killing the elderly man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police said the murder took place at around 5 pm on Poush 26. Mansur has confessed to slitting Thapa\u2019s throat with a knife. The knife used in the crime has also been recovered from the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mansur, who works at a plywood factory, allegedly killed the elderly man with a knife and dumped the body into the well around midnight. \u201cThe murder occurred around 5 pm, and the body was thrown into the well at around 11:55 pm,\u201d an investigating officer said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The well where the body was dumped is located about 200 meters from the factory. Police said Mansur was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the murder. Further investigation is underway against him on charges of murder.</p>\n",

Following this, arrangements were made to hold the National Assembly meeting at Singha Durbar as an alternative venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee hall has been prepared for the Assembly session. Spokesperson Giri said, \u201cNinety per cent of the work has been completed, and the remaining work will be finished before Magh 4.\u201d The government has already decided to convene the National Assembly meeting on Magh 4. For this purpose, the Cabinet has made a decision and recommended to the President to summon the session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the Constitution, the President summons and prorogues sessions of Parliament on the recommendation of the government. Accordingly, the government has forwarded its recommendation to the President.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Assembly meeting is being convened following the Gen-Z movement. The movement took place on Bhadra 23 and 24. After the movement, an interim government was formed and the House of Representatives was dissolved. On the recommendation of the interim government, the President prorogued the National Assembly session on Bhadra 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Parliament Secretariat, there are several agenda items for the upcoming National Assembly session, including some bills and ordinances introduced by the government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, parliamentary committee study reports and annual reports are also on the agenda. Once the session begins, lawmakers may table resolution motions, attention motions, and motions of urgent public importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Assembly also conducts a direct question-and-answer session with ministers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The Board reportedly owes the hospital around Rs 400 million in unpaid dues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the hospital incurs monthly expenses of more than Rs 50 million, only about 50 per cent of its insurance claims have been approved, further aggravating the financial strain, the administration said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hospital also pointed out a significant disparity between the treatment rates set by the Health Insurance Board and the hospital\u2019s actual costs. Despite repeated appeals, the hospital said there has been no response. \u201cFor the past two years, the hospital has been meeting daily expenses from its own internal resources. We can no longer continue providing insurance services at a loss,\u201d the hospital said in a notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information Officer Dr Gopal Sedain said a large portion of the amounts claimed by the hospital in various fiscal years remains unpaid. \u201cDue to the lack of payments, it has become difficult to manage expenses from internal resources. We have also been unable to pay medicine and medical supply vendors for the past five months,\u201d Dr Sedain told Onlinekhabar. \u201cWhen it became clear that services could not continue at a loss, we decided to suspend them.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Health Insurance Board, more than Rs 11 billion remains unpaid to listed health institutions. Hospitals have warned that they may suspend health insurance services within weeks if payments for treatments provided to insured patients are not cleared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, insured citizens are likely to be deprived of services, increasing the risk of the health insurance programme being left in limbo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the health insurance scheme, hospitals are required to submit claims to the Health Insurance Board for treatments provided to insured citizens, after which the Board must make payments. However, due to insufficient government subsidies, the Board has been unable to pay service providers.</p>\n",

A total of 10 nations, including host Nepal, will compete in the biggest ICC event Nepal has ever hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top four teams from the tournament will qualify for the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, scheduled to be held in England and Wales later this year. The competition also features three Test-playing nations, including Zimbabwe, Ireland and Bangladesh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside them, Nepal, Scotland, Namibia, the United States, Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Netherlands and Thailand are competing as associate nations. Nepal have been placed in <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/womens-t20-world-cup-global-qualifier-groups-and-schedule-announced.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/womens-t20-world-cup-global-qualifier-groups-and-schedule-announced.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Group B </a>along with Scotland, the Netherlands, Thailand and Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All four of Nepal\u2019s group opponents are ranked higher than Nepal in the ICC Women\u2019s T20I rankings. Nepal currently sit 21st, while each of the other teams occupies a superior position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal have previously faced Thailand and the Netherlands, but will be meeting Scotland and Zimbabwe for the first time in international cricket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the tournament, Harshal Jayant Pathak was appointed head coach of the Nepal women\u2019s team. Coach Pathak has expressed optimism about Nepal\u2019s chances of qualifying for the World Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am positive that we can qualify. There are challenges, but this team has the ability. The players are very eager to perform well and can align with the team\u2019s plans,\u201d Pathak says. \u201cI see a strong possibility of qualification, especially as we are playing at home.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team captain Indu Barma also said the team has prepared well with the goal of qualification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are preparing well. Regardless of the opponents, our mindset is to perform well on match day. We need to deliver our best from our side,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we take a closer look at the teams Nepal will face in the Women\u2019s World Cup Global Qualifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thailand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thailand are a familiar opponent for the Nepal women\u2019s cricket team. Nepal have faced Thailand seven times in Women\u2019s T20Is and has lost all seven matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thailand have previously featured in the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. They played in the 2020 edition held in Australia but failed to progress beyond the group stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thailand have also participated in the Women\u2019s Asia Cup in 2012, 2016, 2018, 2022 and 2024. In the 2022 Asia Cup, Thailand defeated Pakistan and reached the semifinals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thailand are ranked 12th in the ICC Women\u2019s T20I rankings. Nepal last faced Thailand in the Super Three stage of the Women\u2019s Asia World Cup Qualifier, where Nepal suffered a defeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scotland</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotland is the highest-ranked associate team in women\u2019s cricket and is currently placed 11th in the ICC Women\u2019s T20I rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotland has also played in a Women\u2019s T20 World Cup once. They played in the 2024 edition held in the UAE but were unable to advance beyond the group stage. Based on that performance, Scotland earned direct qualification to the Global Qualifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scotland has played 73 Women\u2019s T20I matches so far, winning 43 and losing 29, with one match producing no result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal have not yet faced Scotland in an official T20I. However, the two teams played a practice match on Friday, where Nepal lost by 27 runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Netherlands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands are ranked 14th in the ICC Women\u2019s T20I rankings. Although the Dutch women\u2019s team have played in four ODI World Cups, they have yet to feature in a Women\u2019s T20 World Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands qualified for the Global Qualifier as runners-up of the European Qualifier Division One. Group winners Ireland are placed in the other group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands women\u2019s team have played 99 T20Is, winning 46 and losing 47, with two ties and four no-results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In head-to-head encounters, Nepal have lost all three T20I matches against the Netherlands. The two sides first met during a tri-nation series held in Nepal in January\u2013February last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Netherlands have also defeated Test nation Zimbabwe once.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zimbabwe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe are ranked 15th in the ICC Women\u2019s T20I rankings and has yet to play in a Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. They qualified for the Global Qualifier through the African Qualifiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe have played 82 Women\u2019s T20Is, winning 55 and losing 26, with one match ending in a tie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal have not faced Zimbabwe so far. A practice match scheduled for Sunday could not take place as the Zimbabwean team had not arrived in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zimbabwe won the gold medal in cricket at the 2023 African Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

In such weather, common practices to protect against the cold include wearing warm clothes, using quilts or blankets, and warming up near fires or heaters. However, keeping the body warm only from the outside is not enough. It is equally important to keep the body warm and strong from within.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During winter, problems such as the common cold, cough, sore throat, joint pain, respiratory issues, and fatigue are more common. The body needs strength to cope with these conditions, and that strength does not have to be sought elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be found right in our own kitchens. Here, Acupuncture Specialist, Dr Narendra Lamichhane, currently working at Gandaki Ayurveda Hospital in Pokhara, suggests the following tips to keep the body warm from within this winter:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Ginger and garlic</strong>: According to Ayurveda, ginger and garlic, commonly used spices in our kitchens, help maintain warmth in the body. They assist in regulating internal body temperature. Modern science also supports this. Compounds such as gingerol in ginger and allicin in garlic help boost metabolism, improve blood circulation, and generate natural heat in the body. As a result, consuming ginger and garlic in winter helps prevent sluggishness, maintain energy levels, and reduce the effects of a cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Turmeric:</strong> Turmeric is one of the most effective spices during winter. The curcumin found in turmeric helps reduce inflammation, strengthen the immune system, and fight infections. It is especially beneficial for joint pain, sore throat, and frequent colds common in winter. Drinking warm milk mixed with turmeric is considered one of the best home remedies for the cold season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Jaggery: </strong>Jaggery holds special importance in winter. It provides quick energy, helps purify the blood, and reduces weakness caused by cold weather. This is why eating chaku and sesame laddoos during winter is a traditional practice. Jaggery helps maintain the body\u2019s temperature balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Pulses and protein-rich foods</strong>: Pulses such as lentils, peas, chickpeas, horse gram, and beans provide energy and keep the body warm for longer periods. The protein they contain strengthens muscles and reduces cold-related weakness. Eating light yet nutritious food during winter is highly beneficial for health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Spices:</strong> Spices such as cumin, coriander, black pepper, and cinnamon are particularly useful in winter. They improve digestion, generate warmth in the body, and help reduce gas and bloating. When used regularly in small amounts, these spices work like natural medicine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happens if the body is not kept warm from within?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In winter, many people experience cold hands and feet, a heavy body, and persistent fatigue. The foods mentioned above improve blood circulation, helping warmth reach every part of the body. Regular consumption reduces cold-induced sluggishness, keeps the body active, and strengthens immunity, protecting against seasonal infections. Besides food there are other things that should be done to keep the body warm from within and they are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Sunbathing and physical activity</strong>: Food alone is not enough to keep the body warm in winter. Sun exposure and physical activity are equally important. Morning sunlight in winter is like nectar for the body. Sunbathing helps the body produce vitamin D, which strengthens bones and boosts immunity, while also keeping the body warm. Light exercise, yoga, or walking improves blood circulation, helps maintain body warmth, keeps the body agile, and boosts energy levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Adequate sleep and stress reduction</strong>: The body needs more rest during winter. Adequate sleep helps restore energy and improve immunity. Stress can make the body feel colder and reduce motivation and energy for physical activity. Therefore, practising meditation, pranayama, or other calming activities is beneficial for maintaining good health during winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Without formal exposure to world literature, he initiated the expansion of his state by integrating multiple fragmented principalities into a single, larger political entity, a process now referred to as unification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when Nepal was divided into many small states, the King of Gorkha led the effort to unify them into Greater Nepal while pursuing a balanced foreign policy. His famous characterisation of Nepal as a \u201cyam between two boulders\u201d remains relevant today, particularly in the context of Nepal\u2019s role as a bridge between powerful neighbours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His ambitious and courageous nature played a crucial role in shaping the unification process and in the creation of a strong and sovereign state. The unification campaign was not merely a territorial expansion; it was a strategic effort focused on consolidation, internal stability, and protection from external powers. Through military strength, strategic manoeuvring, advanced weaponry, diplomatic skill, and long-term vision, he laid the foundation of modern Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without explicitly referencing Sun Tzu\u2019s <em>The Art of War</em>, Chanakya\u2019s <em>Arthashastra</em>, or Thucydides\u2019 <em>History of the Peloponnesian War</em>, Prithvi Narayan Shah followed indigenous wisdom, including the counsel of Bise Nagarchi. Many of his strategies resonate with later theoretical perspectives on the nation-state and nation-building, particularly those of Francis Fukuyama and Michel Foucault. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fukuyama emphasises political order, strong institutions, and governance mechanisms as the foundation of a stable state, while Foucault focuses on power and governance, examining how authority and social control shape societies. Together, these perspectives provide valuable insights into understanding the processes and challenges of building a unified and resilient nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Nepal, the core task of state-building was largely accomplished in the past through unification, which laid the foundation for a sovereign and culturally integrated nation. However, subsequent efforts needed to focus on strengthening institutions, governance mechanisms, and political stability to ensure the effective functioning of the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Political upheavals over the past eight decades have raised serious questions about the sustainability of Nepal\u2019s nation-building achievements. Frequent changes in governance and prolonged instability suggest that even past gains are under threat. Structures established to maintain unity have been repeatedly challenged, from the mass movements of 1950, 1990, and 2006 to more recent Gen-Z-led movements. These developments highlight the fragility of political order and raise doubts about whether state-building can firmly take root in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From the Rana regime to the introduction of democracy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1950s marked a transformative period in Nepal\u2019s history. The end of the 104-year Rana autocracy ushered in a democratic era. Following the establishment of democracy in 1950, successive governments initiated policy changes aimed at reshaping various sectors of society. During this period, Nepal signed the 1950 Peace and Friendship Treaty with India, establishing a foundational framework for bilateral relations that continues to influence ties today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this era remained one of political transition. The limitations of the 1950 treaty have become increasingly apparent in the context of changing security architecture and border tensions. India\u2019s refusal to accept the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) proposal to revise the treaty has further strained relations, suggesting potentially rougher waters ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From absolute to semi-constitutional monarchy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1960, executive and emergency powers were centralised, and the elected Congress government was dissolved amid allegations of corruption, poor governance, and threats to national unity. Popular discontent within the Panchayat system grew, culminating in the 1990 movement, when a left-democratic alliance launched mass demonstrations and strikes to restore multiparty democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although democracy was restored, nation-building once again faced setbacks due to political instability. The shift from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy aimed to promote inclusive governance but was soon followed by the Maoist insurgency in 1996 and renewed political fragmentation, compounded by monarchical interference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This phase ended with the <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/np061122comprehensive20peace20agreement20between20the20government20and20the20cpn2028maoist29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA)</a> in 2006 and the declaration of Nepal as a Federal Democratic Republic, followed by the promulgation of a <a href=\"https://lawcommission.gov.np/content/13437/nepal-s-constitution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new constitution in 2015</a>. The constitution established inclusive democracy, secularism, and a development vision oriented towards socialism with economic growth. However, persistent carousel leadership within political parties has weakened policy continuity, accountability, and public trust. Frequent leadership changes and the recycling of political elites have discouraged long-term planning, domestic confidence, and foreign investment, undermining nation-building efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key challenges to nation-building</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Political Instability:</strong><br>Frequent government changes, ageing political leadership, internal party power struggles, and a lack of visionary leadership remain major obstacles. Without stability, long-term governance and development plans cannot be effectively implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Weak Institutions:</strong><br>Strong institutions are essential for governance, the rule of law, security, and public service delivery. In Nepal, politically influenced and underdeveloped institutions have emerged as a critical challenge to sustaining nation-building progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Fragmentation:</strong><br>Deepening divisions along ethnic, linguistic, cultural, religious, and economic lines have intensified social tensions. Growing inequality, unemployment, and distrust undermine social cohesion and a shared national identity, particularly in the digital era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corruption and Governance:</strong><br>Corruption\u2014deeply embedded in practices of bribery and patronage\u2014has eroded public trust in political parties, leaders, and institutions. It diverts resources from essential services, fuels inequality, and weakens the social contract between the state and its citizens. Unemployed youth, frustrated by corruption and exclusion, have become a volatile force against the established political order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Geopolitical, Geo-economic, and Security Dynamics:</strong><br>Chronic political instability undermines coherent policymaking, while weak security structures threaten state capacity. Nation-building today requires comprehensive security, encompassing health, education, environmental safety, cybersecurity, food security, and political stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these challenges remain unaddressed and carousel leadership persists, even the achievements of past nation-building efforts risk being lost. Upholding Prithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s vision, ensuring public trust in institutions, equality in society, and security in all dimensions of life, is essential. Without this, Nepal\u2019s pursuit of a strong, sovereign, and resilient state may remain incomplete amid ongoing instability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

It is suspected that it could be one of the two buses that went missing in Simaltal, Bharatpur Metropolitan City-29, last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wreckage was found approximately 200 meters closer to the Tanahun side than the place where the bus went missing. According to Prateek Singh, Inspector of the Muglin Area Police Office, locals reported seeing something resembling a bus after discovering a fishing net that had become stuck while they were fishing. Immediately, upon noticing the bus buried in sand, digging work started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him, the blue-colored one seen matches the colour of the Ganapati bus that disappeared in Simaltal, so it may be the same bus. However, he informed that certainty could only be given after the bus is fully retrieved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 12 July 2024, two buses went missing along with a landslide from Simaltal on the Narayangadh\u2013Muglin road section into the Trishuli River. The Ganapati bus numbered Bagmati Province\u201303\u2013001 Kha 2495 and the Angel Deluxe bus numbered Bagmati Province\u201303\u2013006 Kha 1516 went missing in Trishuli.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of 65 people on the two buses, 11 bodies were recovered, and three were injured. DSP Rabindra Khanal from the District Police Office stated that 51 people went missing in the incident.</p>\n",

It failed to last even 12 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement, <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/united-rabi-balen-and-kulman.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/united-rabi-balen-and-kulman.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forged </a>in the name of creating an alternative political force, ultimately collapsed due to disputes over positions, roles, and leadership. While the parties publicly cited ideological differences and procedural problems, personal ambitions and questions of individual political survival were deeply embedded in the deal from the outset. The understanding was largely personality-driven, with ambiguity over power-sharing and an early clash over leadership dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two parties had signed a seven-point agreement, drawing inspiration from the Gen Z movement of September 8 and 9, anti-corruption awareness, good governance, and the slogan of meritocracy. The agreement pledged to build a new political force through the collaboration of all \u201ccivilised and change-oriented forces.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while the agreement appeared idealistic on paper, its implementation proved deeply contradictory. Despite commitments to democratic practice, inclusiveness, and a merit-based system, the leadership structure was already effectively \u201cfixed,\u201d triggering disputes from the very beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of disputes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several provisions of the seven-point agreement themselves became sources of controversy. Most notably, the fourth point stated that RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane would continue as party chair even after unification, with Kulman Ghising, DP Aryal, and Swarnim Wagle serving as vice-chairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This provision reduced Ujyaalo Nepal to a group being absorbed rather than an equal partner. The lack of clear power-sharing in leadership roles immediately fuelled dissatisfaction within Ujyaalo Nepal. While it was initially said that all three vice-chairs would hold equal status, RSP leaders claim that after the agreement, Ghising demanded the position of senior vice-chair, something RSP was unwilling to accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ujyaalo Nepal leaders, apart from vice-chair positions, no other key posts were offered to them. Ujyaalo Nepal had demanded at least one general secretary position in addition to a vice-chair. However, since there was already an understanding to allocate the general secretary post to the Balen group, Lamichhane\u2019s faction refused to accept that demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ravi-balen-kulman-1-1024x500-1.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the last-minute deal that united Rabi, Balen and Kulman\" class=\"wp-image-577369\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it was agreed that Ujyaalo Nepal would get 21 members in the central committee, this was later reduced to just 12, further deepening dissatisfaction on Ghising\u2019s side. Ujyaalo Nepal had initially formed a 51-member central committee, later expanding it to 94. Ghising argued that securing 21 central committee members was necessary to keep his group unified, but the demand was not met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disputes also arose over the selection of proportional representation (PR) candidates. Ujyaalo Nepal initially demanded 18 PR slots, but only 14 names were eventually included. Even the PR list itself triggered controversy, with leaders including Mahendra Lawati raising objections from the outset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth point of the agreement promised responsibility based on merit, inclusiveness, and public image. However, Ujyaalo Nepal activists argued that this principle was not reflected even in the PR candidate selection process. They complained that they were treated merely as supporters of RSP rather than equal partners. This resentment intensified, leading to the collapse of the unity within 12 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the understanding that he would become a vice-chair after unification, Kulman Ghising faced a moral dilemma over continuing in his ministerial post and eventually resigned. He held multiple rounds of talks with Lamichhane regarding party integration. However, according to a Ujyaalo Nepal leader, Ghising decided to part ways after realising that he would not be accorded a dignified and meaningful role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both RSP and Ujyaalo Nepal leaders had long criticised older parties for power-hunger, factionalism, and internal power struggles. Ironically, they ended up displaying the same behaviour and style they had condemned, ultimately leading to the breakdown of their unity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one side stood Rabi Lamichhane\u2019s strong public image and established party structure; on the other, Kulman Ghising\u2019s popularity and activist-based organisation. They aimed to combine these strengths into a formidable political force. However, another key figure, Balendra Shah, was already involved. Shah had merged his group into RSP days earlier, and there was even an understanding within RSP to project him as a future prime ministerial candidate. With prior agreements already in place between Lamichhane and Shah, Ghising reportedly felt his role would be marginal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement also stipulated that the party name, flag, and election symbol would all remain those of RSP, offering no guarantee that Ujyaalo Nepal\u2019s identity would be preserved. This sent a message of merger rather than genuine unity. Ghising\u2019s side had proposed changing the party name, but this was unacceptable to Lamichhane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Differences over party operations, public messaging, and organisational expansion surfaced soon after unification. Ujyaalo Nepal leaders complained of a limited role in decision-making, an order-driven leadership style rather than consultative discussions, and an unclear political future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Kulman Ghising has decided to take Ujyaalo Nepal forward independently once again and is set to assume the role of party chair himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very first point of the agreement had committed to honouring the sacrifices of those killed and injured in the Gen Z movement and addressing its demands. Yet the unity between these two parties appeared centred more on individuals and positions than on those ideals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The episode once again highlights the complexity of building a new political force in Nepal. It shows that unity cannot be sustained through slogans alone, without clear structures, democratic decision-making, and a balanced distribution of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collapse of the RSP\u2013Ujyaalo Nepal unity raises a fundamental question: are the so-called new political forces truly carrying new political values, or merely repackaging old styles in a new form?</p>\n",

The elephant has been named \u2018Bhimgaj\u2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to centre chief Manpuran Chaudhary, Bhimgaj has been seen around the centre for about a week. He said the elephant has appeared in apparent competition with another male elephant, \u2018Ronaldo\u2019, which has been frequenting the area for the past month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRonaldo has been staying here for nearly a month, and now Bhimgaj has arrived. They are trying to chase each other away,\u201d Chaudhary said, adding that although Ronaldo is older, larger and stronger, Bhimgaj has not retreated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronaldo, estimated to be around 53 years old, attempts to prevent other male elephants from approaching the area. Chaudhary said both Bhimgaj and Ronaldo have had physical contact with a female elephant named Koshikali.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bhimgaj is estimated to be around 17 to 18 years old. Chaudhary noted that the elephant is young and gaining strength, and could pose serious competition to older males in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaudhary said Bhimgaj was first spotted in the park last year, when it reportedly chased staff, forcing security personnel to fire warning shots in self-defence. As the elephant had attacked the Bhimpur post at the time, it was named \u2018Bhimgaj\u2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the Chitwan elephant breeding centre houses 10 elephants along with nine calves. Two elephants raised at the centre, Khagendraprasad and Rudrakali, were sent to Qatar as a gift about a month ago.</p>\n",

Leaders from major political parties even refused to discuss his candidacy, claiming that it held no significance. Gradually, as he moved through the city on his campaign trail, dressed entirely in black, dark glasses on, the national flag draped over one shoulder, his following expanded; from a handful of curious onlookers to hundreds, from hundreds to thousands, and, before long, from thousands to hundreds of thousands. In the end, the popular rapper and the underdog candidate Balen emerged victorious and became mayor, making him one of the youngest mayors in Nepal at the age of thirty-two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/balen-shah-kathmandu-mayor-change.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/balen-shah-kathmandu-mayor-change.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">won the election </a>with 61,767 votes, while his closest rivals, Srijana Singh of the Nepali Congress and Keshav Sthapit of the CPN-UML, garnered 38,341 and 38,117 votes, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His effective use of social media and frequent appearances in media interviews helped him gain visibility. At the same time, the weak candidates from major political parties further propelled public support toward Balen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the election, he was easily accessible to the media for interviews. During this period, his attitude in media interviews also played a crucial role in convincing people to support him, as he focused on his strengths, expertise, and vision rather than criticising other candidates. His confidence, too, was striking. At one point, he publicly predicted that he would secure exactly 90,835 votes, a figure that ultimately went unrealised, but revealed the scale of his self-belief.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was also not even aware of him [Balen] when he filed his candidacy for the post of mayor,\u201d says Political Analyst Indra Adhikari. \u201cAt the time, the public was frustrated with traditional political parties, which had repeatedly failed to meet public expectations. In this context, Balen emerged as an alternative.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His victory even influenced the Parliamentary Elections of November 2022, inspiring new parties/ faces to contest the elections and challenge established political parties. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, the newly formed political party at the time, ended up being the fourth-largest party in parliament. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/world/asia/nepal-kathmandu-mayor-balen.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/world/asia/nepal-kathmandu-mayor-balen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York Times</a> has mentioned the trend as \u201cBalen Effect,\u201d quoting political analysts.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Distance draws criticism</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"629\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Balen-shaha-2-1024x629-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rabi Lamichhane and Balen Shah hold one-on-one talks on alternative political front\" class=\"wp-image-577225\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After taking the position of mayor, Balen\u2019s relationship with the public and the press shifted noticeably. The position demands a degree of visibility and exchange, regular conversations with citizens, and a willingness to explain decisions, but he has largely kept his distance. His socialising skills have always been questioned. In the four years since taking the position, he has not given a single interview to a national media outlet, not even a brief sound bite, choosing instead to communicate almost entirely through social media, where his posts often receive thousands of likes, shares, and comments within minutes. That choice has drawn criticism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sociologist Dipesh Ghimire, an Assistant Professor at the Central Department of Sociology, Tribhuvan University, says this disengagement raises serious concerns about democratic accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNot engaging with the media may be defensible, but failing to engage with the public is more problematic. Nepal\u2019s Constitution and the Local Government Operation Act envision local leaders as politically accountable and transparent to citizens,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Act mandates that local governments conduct public hearings every four months, carry out social audits, and ensure regular live interactions by elected representatives. However, Balen has not consistently fulfilled these obligations, raising questions about his adherence to the spirit of the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ghimire, Balen\u2019s distance from the public remains one of his weakest points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sasmit Pokharel, leader of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and a close aide of Balen, defended the mayor\u2019s approach. He explained that previously, the mayor held centralised authority and was expected to oversee every type of work, from appointing school principals to selecting members of management committees. Everyone wanted to meet the mayor regardless of the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSince the mayor had just five years and a lot of work to accomplish, to make things more effective, he adopted a decentralised approach,\u201d Pokharel says. \u201cUnder this system, people would meet the authorities of the relevant department rather than the mayor directly. For instance, if someone had an issue related to education, they would meet the officials from the education department. This approach has empowered every department.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that this did not mean Balen avoided interaction entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe met every individual whenever it was necessary,\u201d Pokharel, highlighting that decentralisation was intended to make city governance more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That distance, however, has not diminished his popularity. Ghimire argues that this paradox must be understood within Nepal\u2019s political culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn Nepal\u2019s political context, leaders have long been known for making grand promises and outlining ambitious plans, only to fail in execution, repeatedly disappointing the public,\u201d he says. \u201cBalen, by contrast, has distinguished himself through relative restraint in speech. Because he speaks less, public expectations of him have remained lower.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghimire adds that limited interaction can sometimes shield leaders from scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn such circumstances, rather than questioning the leader, people often engage by offering opinions about his actions. The more a leader interacts publicly, the more scrutiny and questions they tend to face,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balen has been frequently criticised for his social media posts, some of which contain foul language and appear to encourage violence. During the campaign, he promised to resolve Kathmandu\u2019s waste-management crisis; the problem persists, and so does the criticism. Questions have also been raised about his ability to effectively deploy the city\u2019s budget. And yet, despite these shortcomings, or perhaps alongside them, his political momentum has only intensified.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDespite widespread criticism of Balen\u2019s performance, many people continue to support him because, during his tenure, he has shown that he acts on his convictions and does not yield to pressure or external influence,\u201d Adhikari says. \u201cHe has not displayed traits associated with corruption or greed, which is why many still place their trust in him.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not to say that his tenure has been without accomplishment, but the contrast between expectation and execution remains stark. During his tenure, KMC demolished illegally built structures, including buildings constructed without permits. Following the anti-encroachment drive, KMC worked on widening footpaths, making it easier for pedestrians to walk. However, this initiative also received criticism; critics argued that the metropolitan city acted without providing viable alternatives. As one of his own songs says, <em>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-SAvHLt1E&amp;list=RDIr-SAvHLt1E&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUkR2FyaWIgS28gQ2hhbWVsaSBCb2xkaW5leSBLb2UgQ2hhaW5hoAcB\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir-SAvHLt1E&amp;list=RDIr-SAvHLt1E&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUkR2FyaWIgS28gQ2hhbWVsaSBCb2xkaW5leSBLb2UgQ2hhaW5hoAcB\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Garib Ko Chameli Boldiney Koe Chaina</a>\u201d</em> (there is no one to speak for the poor), the footpath widening drive disproportionately affected street vendors, most of whom come from economically weak backgrounds, highlighting a contradiction between Balen\u2019s artistic voice and the social consequences of his governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KMC\u2019s decisions and actions were communicated through official notices and social media platforms, and meetings were live-streamed to the public, a gesture towards transparency. Regulations on hoarding boards and street advertisements were enforced effectively. Murals reflecting culture and tradition were painted in different parts of the city. Another significant initiative has been KMC\u2019s strict monitoring of whether Kathmandu-based schools have provided scholarships to eligible students, as a result of which a large number of students have received the scholarship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the concept of Book-Free Friday was introduced in Kathmandu\u2019s schools, where students engage in creative activities on Fridays instead of routine textbook learning. This initiative was one of the commitments frequently highlighted during his election campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Balen eyes premiership</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ravi-balen-kulman-1-1024x500-1.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the last-minute deal that united Rabi, Balen and Kulman\" class=\"wp-image-577369\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, Balen\u2019s influence has expanded further with his alignment with the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which has begun positioning him as a future prime ministerial figure. According to the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rsp-and-mayor-balen-unite.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rsp-and-mayor-balen-unite.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">agreement</a>, Rabi Lamichhane is set to remain the party\u2019s central chairperson, while Balendra Shah, following the next House of Representatives election, would assume the role of parliamentary party leader and emerge as its candidate for prime minister.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Gen Z protests of September 8 and 9, Gen Z leaders even proposed Balen as the prime minister of an interim government. He declined the offer, possibly because he had a larger plan in mind, to seek the prime ministership for a full five-year term through the democratic process rather than serve for just seven months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ghimire warns that the very traits that have sustained Balen\u2019s popularity at the local level could become liabilities at the national stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBalen is widely viewed as a potential prime minister. However, if he were to assume that role while maintaining the same detached approach, he would likely encounter serious challenges early in his tenure,\u201d Ghimire says. \u201cA head of government must regularly address and engage with the public. Without such interaction, sustaining leadership over the long term would be difficult.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhikari echoes Ghimire in arguing that Balen would need to change his approach if he were to become prime minister; otherwise, he would likely face a swift decline soon after assuming office.</p>\n",

The protected area extends from Tedhiya in Rajapur Municipality\u20133 and Chhediya of Tikapur\u20134 to Anarhawa of Tikapur\u20138.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The designated river section has been identified as an ecologically critical zone, serving as breeding, spawning and nursery habitat for indigenous fish species. It also provides essential habitat for nationally and internationally significant aquatic wildlife, including Gangetic dolphins, gharials and otters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tikapur Mayor Ramlal Dagaura said the joint declaration reflects full ownership and commitment from both local governments, underscoring collective responsibility for aquatic conservation at the local level. Rajapur Mayor Dipesh Tharu described the move as the foundation for long-term, coordinated conservation of the lower Karnali ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sanctuary has been declared in accordance with the Aquatic Animals Protection Act. An eight-point joint commitment outlines a co-management model led by local governments in partnership with river-dependent communities. Community-based river management groups will oversee monitoring, awareness and rule enforcement in coordination with forest offices and security agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initiative is supported by WWF Nepal under a Darwin Initiative-funded project of the UK government, in collaboration with government agencies and local organisations. WWF Nepal Country Representative Dr Ghan Shyam Gurung said the sanctuary would help protect critical river habitats while supporting livelihoods and cultural traditions linked to the Karnali River.</p>\n",

With this ascent, Budha Magar has become the first double above-knee amputee climber to complete the Seven Summits\u2014scaling the highest mountains on all seven continents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He departed for Antarctica from the United Kingdom on Christmas Eve and, accompanied by his support team, Aviral Rai, Mingma Sherpa, and Jangbu Sherpa, completed the demanding climb in three days. He reached the 4,892-metre summit at 10 pm on January 6, 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Battling the extreme cold of minus 25 degrees Celsius, fierce winds, and steep icy slopes with the help of prosthetic legs, Budha Magar has sent a powerful message to the world that \u201cnothing is impossible.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking after the climb, he said his dream and determination prove that any obstacle in life can be overcome. He expressed hope that this achievement would serve as a milestone in changing perceptions toward persons with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have shown that nothing is impossible and raised awareness about disability,\u201d Budha Magar says after reaching the summit. \u201cWe have inspired others to climb their own mountains and pursue their dreams, no matter what.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added, \u201cIf you have a dream and dedicate yourself to it, you can achieve anything.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/612063903_1522431449882267_4414472313989509595_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577684\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Budha Magar said he planned the Seven Summits campaign to raise awareness about disability and to inspire others like him to fulfil their own dreams of climbing mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He expressed heartfelt gratitude to his family, friends, supporting organisations, and well-wishers for helping make his historic journey a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Mount Vinson, Budha Magar had already climbed the highest peaks of six continents. He summited Mont Blanc (4,810 m) in Europe on August 13, 2019, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m) in Africa on January 8, 2020, Mount Everest (8,849 m) in Asia on May 19, 2023,  Denali (6,194 m) in North America on June 28, 2024, Aconcagua (6,961 m) in South America on February 22, 2025,  and Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m) in Oceania on October 18, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also made history by becoming the first person without both legs to summit Denali and Carstensz Pyramid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budha Magar\u2019s family currently lives in Canterbury, the United Kingdom. Last year, he received the prestigious MBE award from the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in Mirul, Thawang Rural Municipality of Rolpa, Budha Magar joined the British Army at the age of 19, dreaming of building a better future. At 31, while serving with the Royal Gurkha Rifles, he stepped on an improvised explosive device during deployment in Afghanistan in 2010, losing both legs above the knee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he regained consciousness after the blast, he felt life was over. He went through prolonged physical and mental trauma and developed an addiction to alcohol while trying to numb the pain. At times, he even contemplated suicide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut the love of my family and children made me realise I should not die,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, I began focusing on adventure sports, forgetting my physical disability. When I started skiing, golfing, and cycling, my confidence gradually grew. It helped transform my life.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budha Magar travelled to Europe and the United States to ski and became Nepal\u2019s first athlete with a disability to take up skiing. After receiving mountaineering training, he also worked as a mountain instructor, learning that with willpower, nothing is impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a student, he had read extensively about Mount Everest and was inspired by the stories of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary. Later, he climbed the world\u2019s highest peak himself, setting a world record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked how a person without both legs managed to climb Everest using prosthetic limbs, the former Gurkha soldier often replies, \u201cI climbed Everest not with my legs, but with my inner strength.\u201d</p>\n",

Among them is Vlad Dyachenko, a Madrid-based platform engineer and open-source contributor at Cybergizer, who will speak on programming language design in AI-assisted development environments. Kathmandu-based engineer Amit Timalsina will present on the use of generative AI in clinical trial reviews, highlighting how large medical documents have been processed at a production scale to significantly reduce review time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other speakers include Sayantika Banik, founder of DataJourneyHQ and an open-source contributor based in Chiang Mai, who will address secure and observable large language model (LLM) system design; Dijup Tuladhar, who will discuss the impact of AI tools on design leadership; and Saugat Acharya, principal engineer at Laudio, who will focus on LLM evaluation and observability in product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining from San Francisco, Manu Chatterjee will explain how modern AI systems convert unstructured inputs into decisions and workflows, while Kathmandu-based engineer and educator Pranjal Timsina will examine emerging AI security risks such as data leakage and data poisoning. Haihao Liu, founder and CEO of Ternity Education and an AI researcher with academic training at MIT and Harvard, will speak on AI safety, humanity-first AI, and long-term societal impacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference will also feature a panel discussion titled \u201cWho Owns AI in the Company?\u201d, examining how responsibility for AI systems is distributed across engineering, product, design, legal, and leadership teams as AI becomes embedded in business operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It adds that AI Conf 2026 is being held in Kathmandu to address barriers Nepali professionals face in accessing international conferences, including high costs and visa restrictions, while also positioning Nepal\u2019s technology ecosystem alongside global AI practitioners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to conference sessions, the event will include a community hike in the Kathmandu Valley on the second day to encourage informal networking and collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 400 participants are expected to attend, including professionals from Nepal, the United States, Europe, and Asia. The conference is supported by companies including Programiz, Leapfrog, Care Boarding, Logpoint, SecurityPal AI, Proshore, Gritfeat Solutions, Kantipur NEO, and Fusemachines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further details and agenda updates are available on the official conference website.

In response, the Government of Nepal has taken steps to promote computer education in schools. One recent example is the decision by the newly appointed education minister, Mahabir Pun, to mandate at least one computer teacher in schools. While such policies appear promising at the policy level, their implementation at the grassroots level tells a different story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past three years, I have been working to promote digital literacy and computer science education as the president of Coding for Social Good Nepal. Through this work, I have closely observed both the challenges and opportunities within Nepal\u2019s school education system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to World Bank research, fewer than 10 per cent of schools in Nepal offer structured computer science education, and only about 37 per cent (approximately 4,400 schools) that have computers report using them for teaching and learning. To address this gap, we initiated digital and internet literacy programmes, established computer science clubs in more than 30 schools, guided schools with structured handbooks to use both school-based and online resources, and ran career-awareness campaigns in IT. Through these efforts, we have reached over 10,000 students in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coding for social good Nepal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After starting the first computer science club at my high school, I wanted to replicate the success we experienced through coding workshops for junior students, team-based learning, and collaborative participation. Immediately after completing high school, I co-founded Coding for Social Good Nepal (<a href=\"https://blog.cosognepal.org/the-journey-of-cosog-nepal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cosog Nepal</a>) with Bibek Bhandari, whom I met online. Although our motivations were shaped by different life experiences, we shared a common goal: to make computer science education and coding mainstream in schools across Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Early resistance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I was based in Kirtipur and visited public schools in the Bhatkepati and Panga areas to seek permission for our first outreach sessions. Unfortunately, none of the three public schools granted approval. One school principal asked, \u201cWhat if you teach gambling?\u201d Others demanded a letter from the municipal office for a brief 45-minute session. When we approached the municipal office, officials asked for registration documents. This circular process reflected a familiar Nepali bureaucratic experience faced by citizens attempting to work with government institutions. As a result, we began our outreach with under-resourced private schools in Kirtipur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first official event was held at Green Village English Boarding Secondary School in Kirtipur. We were surprised by the principal\u2019s enthusiasm. Instead of rejecting us outright, he asked about our background, previous work, and the structure and content of the session. He told us it was the first time he had seen such an initiative. During the session, students from Grades 8, 9, and 10 were engaged, curious, and fully attentive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3906\" height=\"1657\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_20240626_155832.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577662\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue, however, was not limited to public schools. Even private schools often lacked trust in their students. I recall a visit to a school in Kapilvastu district, where the administration was sceptical about the programme\u2019s value. They said, \u201cOur students don\u2019t have laptops at home. Even at school, they just stick to the syllabus. They aren\u2019t interested in extra technology.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was given only 45 minutes with Grade 10 students, without a projector. In that time, I spoke about careers in technology, teamwork, participation, and my experience of forming a computer science club and its impact on my school. At the end, I asked a simple question: \u201cWho wants to form a club?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was silence. Not a single hand was raised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I walked down the stairs afterwards, two boys nervously approached me. They whispered that they wanted to start a club but were afraid to raise their hands in front of the class. This was not surprising; I had been the same way once, and I had witnessed similar moments in other programmes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I returned to the administration with this feedback, and they allowed me to speak to Grade 8 students. The same pattern repeated: silence in the classroom, followed by students approaching me individually in the corridors once teachers were out of sight. This experience taught us a crucial lesson. In Nepal, the challenge is not always a lack of resources; it is also a lack of voice. Students are conditioned to be passive listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gap we aim to bridge is not only digital but also cultural. While we teach programming and web development, we prioritise helping students find the courage to raise their hands and speak up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Careers in IT</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2025-02-24-at-14.24.26-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577663\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Nepali students who have just completed Grade 10 face immense pressure, as their choice of academic stream significantly shapes their higher education and career paths. To support them, I organised a virtual programme titled <em>\u201cCS in +2\u201d</em>, aimed at guiding students on selecting appropriate curricula in Grades 11 and 12 to pursue computer science, information technology, or related fields at the undergraduate level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programme featured four speakers from diverse backgrounds and locations: a current student and Apple software engineering intern, a professor from a leading IT college, a leader of a non-profit organisation working for women in STEM, and the CTO of a Nepali company who is also a tech YouTuber. We explained the differences between computer science in the science and management streams, explored various career paths, and discussed education and job opportunities in Nepal and abroad. Hosting this event was a privilege, as it supported over 1,000 students who attended live or later accessed recordings on YouTube and Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Code for Charity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many students in Nepal who are passionate about computer science lack access to practical experience. While they study theory and sometimes attend short courses, they often miss opportunities to work on real projects, receive mentorship, and build professional portfolios. At the same time, many NGOs work on critical social issues but lack the technical and financial capacity to develop websites or digital tools, limiting their outreach and impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code for Charity, a flagship programme of Cosog Nepal, was designed to bridge these two gaps through a dual-impact model. The programme connects student developers with NGOs in need of digital solutions. Beyond matchmaking, we mentor students and collaborate with for-profit companies. We have partnered with organisations such as Fleckor Tech and Cornor Tech in Nepal and India to provide internships and job opportunities to outstanding participants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, the programme has supported over five national and international organisations, including Sustainable Actions Afrika (Cameroon), the National Adolescent Girls\u2019 Network Nepal, and the National Adolescent Boys\u2019 Network Nepal. We have also collaborated with Fleckor Tech, Smart Cheli, and Technify, a student organisation from Duke University, USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impact and Recognition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Through school outreach programmes, CS clubs, and the Code for Charity initiative, Cosog Nepal has reached more than 30 schools, engaged over 10,000 students both online and in person, and supported over five non-profit organisations with pro bono digital solutions. We have mentored more than 40 student developers with hands-on, real-world experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work has received national and international recognition, including being named a semi-finalist in the ICT Award 2025 (Social Innovation category) and receiving an Innovation Grant from the Global E-STEM Award. Our initiatives have been featured in platforms such as TechPana and ICT News, and we have partnered with organisations including Technify (Duke University), Smart Cheli, Paymentology, and Fleckor Tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the Startup and Idea Fest, the recognition and support we received were overwhelming. We are now organising a web development programme for public high school students, where participants will build a website for their own school as a final project within 15 days. Through Coding for Social Good Nepal, my goal is to institutionalise computer science education and ensure that policies translate into meaningful change at the grassroots level across Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

However, many of these traditional water systems have disappeared or are at risk due to rapid urbanisation, environmental degradation, and long-standing neglect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, E-Arts Nepal, the Rotary Club of Yala, and the Chiva Chaitya Organization (CCO), in collaboration with local community stakeholders, have launched a heritage preservation initiative focused on the sensitisation, restoration, and revival of Hitis to ensure their sustainability for future generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exhibition features paintings by 20 contemporary Nepali artists, each interpreting the artistic, cultural, and historical essence of Hitis through diverse visual perspectives. The exhibition is intended to spark public dialogue and encourage collective responsibility toward safeguarding traditional water systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exhibition will formally open on January 9, with an opening ceremony that includes a welcome address by Basanta Raj Shrestha of the Rotary Club of Yala. Hiti expert P.S. Joshi will speak as the special guest, while senior artist Kiran Manandhar will attend as the chief guest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participating artists include Asha Dangol, Bhairaj Maharjan, Bidhata KC, Binod Pradhan, Bishal Maharjan, Erina Tamrakar, Ishan Pariyar, Kripa Tuladhar, Krishna Gopal Shrestha, Krishna Lama, Muna Bhadel, Pradhumma Shrestha, Pradip K. Bajracharya, Pralistha Maharjan, Pramila Bajracharya, Puja Maharjan, Sagar Manandhar, Samjhana Rajbhandari, Shailee Rana, and Shreeju Shahi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

However, reports say that the non-UN bodies include major environmental organisations such as the International Solar Alliance, led by India and France, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The US has also withdrawn from UN-related bodies, including the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the International Law Commission, the International Trade Centre, the Peacebuilding Commission, UN Energy, and the UN Population Fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US has accused these institutions of promoting \u201cradical climate policies, global governance systems, and ideological agendas incompatible with American sovereignty and economic power.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The White House said the decision followed a review of all international intergovernmental organisations, conferences, and treaties in which the United States holds membership or is a party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWithdrawing from these organisations will stop US taxpayer money from supporting globalist agendas. Funds that previously went to institutions that address critical issues in an inefficient or arrogant manner can now be used in other ways,\u201d the statement said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Reuters, the White House has not immediately responded to requests for further details on the list of organisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since beginning his second term, Trump has pursued a policy of reducing US financial contributions to various UN bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NBC News reported that the US has announced its withdrawal from 66 international organisations as part of its continued pullback from global cooperation. Most of these are UN-affiliated bodies, commissions, and advisory committees working on issues such as climate, labour, and migration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration has accused these institutions of promoting \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d initiatives, referring to efforts aimed at addressing social injustice, discrimination, and inequality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this decision, the administration will exit dozens of international organisations, including UN population agencies and agreements that form the basis of international climate negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the White House, the decision followed a review of US participation and funding in all international organisations, including those affiliated with the UN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list also includes non-UN bodies such as the Partnership for Atlantic Cooperation, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, and the Global Counterterrorism Forum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, the US State Department said these organisations were found to be \u201cunnecessary, poorly managed, wasteful, and a threat to US sovereignty and independence.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the Trump administration had already suspended funding to the World Health Organization, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the Human Rights Council, and UNESCO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is the latest step in Trump\u2019s opposition to climate policies. The 1992 convention formed the basis of the historic Paris Agreement. Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a \u201choax.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy called the move \u201cshort-sighted and shameful,\u201d saying it has dismantled decades of US leadership by making the country the only one in the world to withdraw from the agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other organisations the US is leaving include the United Nations University, the International Cotton Advisory Committee, the International Tropical Timber Organization, and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State Department said reviews of additional organisations are still ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

A team from the Bird Conservation Network Kailali had conducted a bird census in Ghodaghodi from January 3 to 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Network Kailali&#8217;s Secretary Ram Kumar Chaudhary said that the population of Greylag Goose has gone up in Ghodaghodi this time. The Greylag Goose is considered the indicative species of this wetland. Bird census is conducted in Ghodaghodi wetlands twice a year \u2013 in winter and summer, and according to this schedule, the bird counting was carried out this year as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three hundred and ninety-four Greylag Goose were counted in this bird sanctuary in 2022. Their number decreased to 316 in 2023, while it went up to 411 in 2024. It again dropped to 372 in 2025. According to Chaudhary, the number of Greylag Goose has increased to 429 this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the number of the Greylag Goose has increased, the number of other water birds has decreased in Ghodaghodi. The bird census conducted in 2022 counted 1,685 birds, while this number decreased to 1,221 in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It increased to 1,437 in 2024. The number of aquatic birds in Ghodaghodi wetlands was 1,316 in 2025, and it has gone down to 1,168 this year, Bird Conservation Network Kailali&#8217;s President Dayaram Chaudhary said. There are 24 small and large lakes in the Ghodaghodi wetland region. The Ghodaghodi Lake is the largest natural water lake in the Tarai region of the country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghodaghodi and Nakarod lakes are considered the most suitable habitats for water birds. Network Kailali President Chaudhary stated that previously the population of aquatic birds in Ghodaghodi was around 2,022, and it has decreased to about 1,100 in recent days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him, the number of aquatic birds is decreasing in Ghodaghodi due to the depletion of their habitat, it is becoming unsafe and the a decrease in bird food. The Sudurpaschim provincial government declared Ghodaghodi as the country&#8217;s first bird sanctuary on March 11, 2022, recognising that this wetland was an important habitat for native and migratory birds. Birds of 381 species are found in and around the Ghodaghodi wetlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The Commission declared on January 7 during an event here that, throughout the election campaign prohibition period, no form of discussion, interaction, assembly, convention, workshop, or seminar is permitted, and it is forbidden to solicit votes or campaign through any method, process, or medium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the newly established regulation, details of campaign expenditures via online media must also be accounted for in election expenses. Political parties, candidates, and party-affiliated organisations are required to conduct their campaigns through online media and report such expenses in the election expense documentation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the new regulation emphasises the internalisation of the complete press freedom guaranteed by the Constitution along with its self-regulation. The definition of social media has been broadened to encompass specific social media platforms, while the utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to contravene the code of conduct in evolving times has also been addressed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provisions have been established to permit promotional materials to be published in any newspaper as part of newspaper promotions, and arrangements have been made to facilitate election campaigns through online media utilising roadblocks, content blocks, homepage banners, detailed page banners, and box advertisements (within the news).</p>\n",

Minister Ghising reached the Prime Minister&#8217;s official residence, Baluwatar, and submitted his resignation before Prime Minister Sushila Karki on January 7. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghising, who had also been in charge of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transportation and Urban Development, was appointed as the minister on September 15, 2025. On this occasion, Prime Minister Karki expressed gratitude for providing able leadership to the three crucial ministries over the past three and a half months, the PM secretariat shared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You have performed as a minister of the incumbent government under very adverse conditions, contributing greatly to the country&#8221;, Prime Minister Karki said. &#8220;You worked untiringly around the clock. You reached various parts of the country and remained equally active during times of disaster. You personally went to disaster-affected areas and worked there, and also took strict measures against irregularities in the development and construction projects. The country will remember your work, and the people will evaluate it.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minister Ghising expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister for providing the opportunity to work during the interim period. Ghising resigned after questions were raised over his affiliation with a political party, preparing to contest the upcoming March 5 elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be noted that an understanding has been reached between the Ujjyalo Party Nepal, which Ghising oversees, and the Rastriya Swatantra Party for a potential merger. According to the understanding, he is set to become the vice president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party.</p>\n",

As a result, industries operating in Tokha Municipality are seeing a surge in activity, with traders working at full capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chaku produced in Tokha is sold across the Kathmandu Valley, including in Ason, Indrachowk, Bhaktapur, Patan, Kirtipur, as well as in cities outside the valley such as Narayanghat, Pokhara, Butwal, and Biratnagar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Newa language, \u2018Tu\u2019 means sugarcane, and \u2018Khya:\u2019 means a place where it grows. Tokha is a place renowned for sugarcane cultivation and chaku production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although demand for chaku is high, producers say they are struggling to keep up with production and deliver products to the market on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industries in Tokha are currently producing a variety of items, including plain chaku, masala chaku, special chaku, white laddu, black laddu, Bombay laddu, pushtakari, bhuja laddu, and almond laddu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Newa culture, it is customary to eat chaku on the first day of Magh. Chaku is also traditionally eaten during cold weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1830\" height=\"1220\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577606\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1830\" height=\"1220\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577607\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-4-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577608\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-5-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577609\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1830\" height=\"1220\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577610\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-6-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577611\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-7-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577612\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-9-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577613\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-11-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577614\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-12-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577615\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-13-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577616\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-14-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577617\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-16-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577619\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-17-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577620\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chaku-Tokha-18-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577621\"/></figure>\n",

Eight women and seven men from the Raute community took part in the training. The Ministry of Social Development in Karnali Province informed that the Raute people live a nomadic life in Surkhet, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Salyan districts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community in a population of 1,033 has lately witnessed a decline owing to a changed lifestyle, especially in food and culture. They are currently living in a jungle of Lekbensi municipality-7 of Surkhet. The health workers at Nepal Red Cross Society Surkhet chapter provided the attending Raute youths the basic skills of first aid, along with the practical exercise, according to Ram Lal Acharya, Surkhet chapter Chair of Nepal Red Cross. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The training is expected to make them aware of the injury and the need for emergency health support before taking the injured ones to the hospital. Minister for Social Development, Ghanashyam Bhandari, inaugurated the training on Tuesday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said it is a common responsibility of all to preserve the Raute community, which bears a special identity in Karnali Province. &#8220;The interest shown by Raute youths in health and treatment should be taken positively,&#8221; he observed, adding that this aboriginal group has a unique civilisation, language and culture. According to him, the provincial government was for socialisation of the Raute people without hampering their original culture and civilisation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The establishment of the &#8216;Raute corridor&#8217; and the launch of the &#8216;Raute policy&#8217; were in the offing. While linking the Raute people to modern practices, their lifestyle bearing a unique identity will not be infringed, he vowed. At the programme, the mayor of Gurans rural municipality, Top Bahadur BC, informed that the Raute people were provided identity cards and social security allowances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The local level had taken an initiative to facilitate the process to ensure citizenship certificates for the aboriginal tribe. The proposal in this regard had reached the district administration office. Hira Singh Thapa, executive director at a non-governmental organisation, Social Service Centre, informed that the Raute people were getting attracted to modern treatment, so the training on first aid would be beneficial to them. The traditional household treatment was causing complications in the treatment of their health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The District Administration Office (DAO), Parsa had imposed a curfew in Birgunj Metropolitan City for the last two consecutive days after the tensions had flared up following a protest demonstration in Birgunj on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The curfew was lifted on Tuesday at 3:00 pm onwards, after which shops were gradually reopened while schools, markets and factories are in full operation from today. According to Bhola Dahal, Chief District Officer (CDO) of Parsa, the situation is returning to normal in Birgunj following a consensus reached in an all-party and all-sides meeting on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CDO Dahal shared that the district administration had imposed a curfew since last Monday amid concerns that communal tension could escalate. He said the measure was taken to maintain peace and security in view of the prospects of communal disputes further flaring up. CDO Dahal further explained that the curfew was ordered to avert untoward incidents and to restore normalcy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the curfew was lifted, local markets have become increasingly bustling yet again, while the movement has resumed on the roads. The protest was triggered by a dispute between Hindu and Muslim communities at Ward No 6 of Kamala Municipality in Dhanusha district last Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of the Muslim community protested the same day over alleged mosque vandalism and arson, while Hindu groups staged protests on Monday, accusing offensive remarks against Hindu temples and deities. The situation later escalated into clashes between the protestors and police on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The journey itself was demanding, with long hours on difficult mountain roads, sharp turns, and unpredictable weather. Our driver, with his patience, safety-conscious driving, and gentle humour, became an unseen pillar of this journey, and we owe him our deep gratitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We visited Khara in Rukum West and the rural municipalities of Putha, Sisne, and Bhume in Rukum East. In both districts, we met survivors of Nepal\u2019s armed conflict (1996\u20132006): women whose husbands were killed or disappeared, women who were injured, and women who survived conflict-related sexual violence. What we encountered was not a story of the past, but a living, breathing present.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rukum West: The living memory of the conflict</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1920\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/khara.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577569\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We left Kathmandu on December 18, 2025 and reached Rukum West the next day. On December 19, 2025, we arrived in Khara, a place etched deeply into Nepal\u2019s conflict history. In 2000, following an attack on an army barracks by Maoist forces, army personnel retaliated by burning down more than 150 houses. Fifteen civilians were forced to stand in a line and were killed together in groups of seven and eight. They were ordinary people, women, men, families, none of whom were part of the Maoist movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we sat with women in Khara for conversation, the conflict did not feel like something that had ended two decades ago. It felt present, heavy, and unresolved. The pain lived in their bodies, in the long pauses between words, in voices that still trembled. Grief had settled into everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the land seemed to mourn, quietly demanding truth and justice, asking why innocent lives were taken in the name of rage and revenge. Homes were burned. Livelihoods were destroyed. Livestock: cows, buffaloes, goats, and sheep were burned alive. Many women survived sexual violence, a crime that remains largely unspoken, unacknowledged, and unaccounted for.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/From-the-window-of-survivors-to-other-survivors-house-where-she-was-raped.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577565\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the window of the survivors to the house where she was raped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, the place from which the Maoist revolution began shows little sign of meaningful human development today. While rough roads have been constructed, women continue to face multiple forms of domestic violence, often linked to the harmful alcohol use of their husbands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Families remain trapped in economic insecurity. Income-generating opportunities are extremely limited due to poor access to markets; even when women produce agricultural goods, selling them is difficult due to the lack of a market. Physical and mental health challenges persist, compounded by inadequate sanitation and hygiene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transitional justice, meanwhile, feels absent, almost asleep, at a time when the country is once again facing constitutional and sovereign uncertainty. The past remains unhealed, and the present feels fragile. As we listened, it became clear how fear was deliberately used by both warring parties, security forces and Maoist cadres, to control, silence, and break communities. The brutality described was beyond imagination, yet shared with restraint and dignity. Sitting there, we felt the weight of their waiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found ourselves asking difficult questions: Where is justice? What does democracy mean for these women? Who is listening to them now? And in this shifting political context, how much longer must women wait for truth, acknowledgement, and accountability? In this shifting political landscape, it remains deeply uncertain whether the lived memories of the past conflict will be treated as a priority or, once again, pushed to the margins, even as the country grapples with the consequences and demands emerging from the Gen Z movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rukum East: Far from the promises of peace and justice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From Rukum West, we travelled to Rukum East, visiting Bhume, Putha, and Sisne, three remote rural municipalities. Over four days, we spoke with nearly 30 survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. Women arrived together, speaking slowly, carefully, and from the heart. As we visited their simple homes and took in the breathtaking landscape, one question returned again and again: Why were these women and families targeted? They lived far below the poverty line, in geographically isolated villages, distant from political power and ideological divisions. Yet violence was enacted upon them by both warring parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a deeply patriarchal system, violence was normalised. Women\u2019s bodies were treated as battlegrounds. Sexual violence was justified through harmful beliefs, that, \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d that sexual desire is uncontrollable, and that masculinity grants entitlement over the powerless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These beliefs enabled armed men to dominate women and other powerless civilians who had no connection to the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/10-most-violent-incidents-during-nepal-civil-war-1996-2006.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maoist revolution</a>, no protection, and no voice. This was not accidental harm. It was the deliberate use of power against those least able to resist, women whose lives were already constrained by poverty, distance, and exclusion. Their suffering reveals the brutal intersection of patriarchy, militarisation, and impunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What struck us most, however, was not only the depth of pain but the quiet strength with which survivors held space for one another. Many had never spoken about their experiences in a collective setting when we first met with them two years back from our organisation-Nagarik Aawaz. In these circles, silence was respected, and tears were welcomed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were not gatherings defined by victimhood, but by survival, resilience, and the slow rebuilding of trust. Despite harsh terrain and long journeys, often walking for hours, women came. Leaving behind household responsibilities, they carried both fear and hope. Their presence itself was an act of courage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Healing, trust and collective care</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When our organisation began working in these areas, we entered unknown territory. In the first focus group discussions, women\u2019s faces reflected exhaustion, frustration, and hopelessness. Many felt life was already over. One and a half years later, we witnessed a profound shift. Survivors spoke of wanting to live, to see the world through their own eyes, to imagine futures beyond survival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everywhere we went, we were welcomed with love. In Bhume, Putha, and Sisne, women came together, bringing saag (spinach), maize, wheat, and meat, and cooking collectively to feed us with joy. Before this initiative, many had never sat together or shared their pain. Now they meet regularly, call each other, and ask about daily life. A community safety net has been rebuilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holistic support, safe spaces, medical care, psychosocial counselling, peace circles, collective healing therapy, and modest cash support to start livelihoods, provided through our program, have transformed their sense of self. Confidence, dignity, and hope have slowly returned. Some women are now preparing to contest local elections in 2027. Others have opened fixed deposits or invested in buffaloes, goats, and sheep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During home visits, we were lovingly forced to eat ghee, milk, and yoghurt from their livestock. Laughing, they told us, \u201cWe will not let you leave without eating the ghee, milk, and yoghurt from the buffalo you helped us buy<em>.\u201d</em> It was not charity, it was shared pride and dignity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beyond silence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What made this journey extraordinary was not only the small intervention we did, but the people. Women were crying, but these were not tears of despair, but of recognition, healing, and shared humanity. This work reminds us that even small organisations, with limited resources, can create meaningful change when they act with integrity and care. And yet, a haunting question remains: Why does the state remain so absent, so unaccountable, so indifferent? Is it fear, denial, arrogance, or deeply rooted patriarchy? These unanswered questions, and this silence, have helped fuel the growing unrest and youth movements we see today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the women of Rukum East continue to rise, with scars and laughter, with milk pots and memories, with grief held gently alongside reclaimed courage. Their journeys remind us that feminist peacebuilding is not only about policies or institutions. It is about presence, love, and refusing to let silence win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Sher is now set to make his international debut on the biggest stage, the World Cup itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside Sher, Basir Ahmad has also made a return to the national squad. Basir last featured for Nepal in the T20 series following the League 2 fixtures in June last year, but missed out on selection for the T20 World Cup Qualifiers. His strong performance in the NPL paved an avenue for his comeback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Kushal Malla and Mohammad Aadil Alam, both of whom played in the Asia and East Asia Pacific World Cup Qualifiers, failed to secure a spot in the final World Cup squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sher shines in the NPL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Representing Lumbini Lions in the second edition of the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tag/nepal-premier-league\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tag/nepal-premier-league\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NPL</a>, Sher played a key role in guiding the team to become the team champion. Beyond the championship win, his overall performance drew widespread attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spinner Sher troubled opposition batters consistently. His all-round contribution also stood out, batting effectively in the lower order while excelling with the ball. He finished the season as the joint-highest wicket-taker, claiming 17 wickets in 10 matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal captain Rohit Paudel had earlier expressed confidence in Sher\u2019s bright future, a sentiment now reflected in his World Cup selection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having previously represented Nepal at the U-19 level and for Nepal \u2018A\u2019, Sher is now set to don the senior national jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Return of Basir\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Basir-Ahamad-cricket-3-1024x683-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577588\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Basir Ahmad, who played two NPL seasons for Biratnagar Kings, has prior experience with both Nepal \u2018A\u2019 and the senior national team, though he struggled to cement a regular spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, through consistent performances for Nepal \u2018A\u2019 and the domestic side Tribhuvan Army Club, Basir has established himself as a dependable middle-order batter. In the latest NPL season, he scored 191 runs in nine matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for his ability to rescue teams from difficult situations, Basir has delivered under pressure before. Against Karnali Yaks in the NPL, he played a match-winning innings in a challenging scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, in the final of the four-nation T20 series in Hong Kong, Nepal slumped to 92-8 against Kuwait. Basir, alongside Nandan Yadav, took the match to the final over, though Nepal eventually fell short by three runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aadil and Kushal miss out</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1754\" height=\"2048\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-Cup-Squad.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577589\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aadil Alam and Kushal Malla, both part of Nepal\u2019s T20 World Cup Qualifier campaign, were excluded from the final squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aadil struggled for form both in the qualifiers and the NPL. He scored 18 runs in two qualifier matches and managed just 93 runs in eight NPL games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kushal Malla also failed to find a rhythm.</p>\n",

It is a professional organisation believed to advocate for ethical practice, the welfare of doctors, better working conditions, and improved healthcare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 1951 by a few doctors, it now claims over 15,000 members, drawn from a pool of more than 40,000 registered medical and dental practitioners. Yet this seemingly impressive growth masks deeper problems. With membership hovering just around 35% of all doctors, questions arise about how effectively the NMA truly represents the profession it claims to speak for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics within the medical community argue that low membership count and its own legislation undermine the legitimacy of the NMA. Many doctors choose not to join, citing high fees and a perception that the organisation serves narrow interests, associated with political interests rather than the broader fraternity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources familiar with internal dynamics say that candidates aspiring to be part of the executive body pay membership fees to potential voters, a practice that raises serious ethical concerns and corruption within the organisation. Such actions suggest vote-buying, eroding trust in the leadership selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The history of NMA is linked to the political evolution of Nepal. Established in the twilight of the Rana era, it grew together with democratic movements. Today, however, politics dominates its internal affairs. Elections for leadership positions often split along party lines, with alliances mirroring national rivalries between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML. Doctors form panels based on ideological affiliations, turning what should be a professional election into a proxy battle for political influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This politicisation has real consequences. Recurring candidates cycle through roles, starting in junior positions and aiming for senior ones in subsequent terms. Promises made during campaigns, from improved workplace safety to equitable postgraduate training, frequently go unfulfilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Past leadership teams pledged dedicated hospitals for complex cases, better duty-hour regulations, raised salaries, and paid travel leave for medical staff. Only a very few of these commitments have materialised, leaving many doctors disillusioned and angry over such betrayal slapped in their face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity due to professional repercussions, described the pattern as a &#8220;musical chairs game&#8221; among the same old faces. This cycle of repetition leads to stagnation, prioritising personal gain over collective progress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also erodes public trust. When political leaders notice doctors affiliated with opposing parties, they often treat them as pawns instead of collaborators in health policy. Conflicts within hospitals and public disagreements add to the strain on doctor-patient relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another concern involves financial transparency. The Nepal Medical Association receives financial assistance from the government and brings in revenue through its journal, rentals at its guesthouse, reading rooms, seminars, and membership fees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered as a non-profit under <a href=\"https://lawcommission.gov.np/content/12249/12249-association-registration-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nepal&#8217;s Association Registration Act</a>, it must go through audits and stay accountable. Still, its official website shows no recent audit reports, which sparks questions about proper oversight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Nepal&#8217;s law, non-profits have to submit audited financial statements to officials like those at the District Administration Office, though the public has little access to them. This opacity fuels suspicions that funds organisation ways be used solely for professional welfare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors face numerous unresolved challenges that highlight the NMA&#8217;s shortcomings. Young doctors, particularly residents in private colleges, go through relatively long working hours with little or no stipend, unlike their counterparts in government institutions or neighbouring countries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workplace violence against health workers persists, despite laws meant to protect them. Post-study bonds and compulsory internships tie doctors to exploitative contracts, mental stress, and low pass rates in licensing exams, mostly below 40 per cent, which point to systemic flaws in the medical education system in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have extensively documented these issues. In our pieces for various media, we exposed the phenomenon of &#8220;phantom faculty&#8221; in private medical colleges qualified doctors were listed only for inspections but absent during actual teaching. We have highlighted defensive medicine driven by consumer court rulings that impose heavy fines on hospitals and doctors for perceived negligence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also addressed professional mental health crises, when stress causes startling rates of burnout and, in severe circumstances, suicide. In contrast, the NMA has published various written comments on some issues but has failed to promote substantial improvements, such as uniform stipends or strict safety measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broader scandals in medical education compound the problem. Investigations have revealed irregularities in college affiliations and seat allocations for undergraduate and postgraduate studies, with allegations of bribery involving regulators, business owners, medical mafias, and politicians. While these centre on the Nepal Medical Council and Medical Education Commission, the NMA&#8217;s silence or limited action allows such issues to fester, affecting the quality of new doctors entering the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Election controversies within the NMA further tarnish the organisation&#8217;s image. Reports of candidate disputes and procedural challenges have surfaced in media outlets. In a recent case,&nbsp;several&nbsp;nomination&nbsp;disputes resulted in legal notices, court orders, and delays, demonstrating how even an election committee for an association of educated professionals&nbsp;can&nbsp;devolve into power struggles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NMA&#8217;s potential remains vast. Acting as a bridge between doctors and the government, the NMA could push hard for universal health coverage. It could also champion welfare for doctors, medical students, and all healthcare workers, while encouraging incentives for postings in rural areas. On top of that, it could drive real policy reforms and maintain ethical standards without any political meddling. Yet it regularly faces low membership, politicises elections, fails\u00a0to provide\u00a0financial openness, and\u00a0disregards\u00a0its own commitments and obligations. NMA risks becoming a relic \u2013 respected in name but ineffective in practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of Nepal&#8217;s turbulent 2025 Gen Z protests, which toppled a government amid demands for an end to entrenched corruption, the appointment of Dr Sudha Sharma Gautam as Health Minister in October and the continued tenure of Prof Dr Anjani Kumar Jha as Vice Chairperson of the Medical Education Commission expose a stark irony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both rose to prominence through leadership roles in the Nepal Medical Association, an organisation long plagued by accusations of political partisanship, financial opacity, vote-buying in elections, and a failure to represent even a third of the country&#8217;s doctors or deliver on pledges for better conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Sharma Gautam presided over the NMA from 2005 to 2007, a period marked by emerging criticisms of transparency lapses, while Dr Jha&#8217;s term from 2013 to 2016 overlapped with escalating scandals in medical college affiliations, seat allocations, and unmet calls for reform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, they occupy pivotal posts overseeing the very sector riddled with unregulated private institutions, abysmal license exam pass rates, rampant doctor migration, workplace violence, resident burnout, and exploitative training bonds, issues the NMA repeatedly failed to resolve under their watch or that of similar recycled leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s healthcare system supports millions of people in tough terrain ranging from the remote Himalayas to metropolitan areas. Doctors require a representation group that prioritises their well-being and patient care over internal power battles. Reform starts with introspection: expanding membership, releasing audits, and emphasising professional unity above partisan differences. Only then can the NMA reclaim its role as a true voice for the nation&#8217;s healers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This constant shuffling between a politically charged professional group and a high-level administrative role sets up a vicious cycle of holdups and conflicts of interest. It chips away at public confidence exactly when Nepal badly needs firm, no-nonsense measures to fix its battered healthcare setup. People saddled with that tainted history ought to step aside, making room for fresh, neutral leaders to address the ingrained problems that continue to perplex patients and medical workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The Nepal Layers Poultry Association has stated that the farm price has been reduced by Rs 90 per crate. The updated prices will be effective from tomorrow. As a result, the price of large-sized eggs (30 pieces) has dropped from Rs 565 to Rs 475 per crate at the farm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the price of medium-sized eggs has decreased from Rs 550 to Rs 460 per crate. According to Binod Pokharel, chairman of the association, the support price is determined based on the rate from large farms, leading to a reduction in consumer prices from Rs 25 to Rs 20 per piece. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chairperson Pokhrel stated that, given the current lower consumption and higher production compared to the past, demand for eggs is expected to increase again as winter subsides and daily life returns to normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The production cost of eggs is Rs 19.12 per egg. Calculating this, the cost price for farmers is Rs 574.06 per crate. If the price of eggs drops again when it is close to the cost price, farmers will incur additional losses,&#8221; he said. The association has been adjusting the support price of eggs in response to market demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Meteorologists at the division said this is the lowest minimum temperature recorded in the capital so far this year. Earlier, at 5:45 am, the minimum temperature in Kathmandu stood at 3.4 degrees Celsius.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to Kathmandu, Lalitpur\u2019s Sanepa area recorded an even lower temperature. Meteorologist Ujjwal Upadhyay said the minimum temperature in Sanepa was measured at 2.8 degrees Celsius this morning, which is 0.5 degrees Celsius lower than the previous day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Kathmandu feel slightly warmer, meteorologists said the minimum temperature has been consistently declining over the past few days, intensifying the cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu recorded a minimum temperature of 4.7 degrees Celsius on Saturday, 4 degrees on Sunday, and 3.5 degrees Celsius on Monday. In Nepal, official minimum temperature data are measured and released daily at 8:45 am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meteorologist David Dhakal noted that while today\u2019s reading is the lowest minimum temperature recorded so far this year in the Kathmandu Valley, it is still slightly above the long-term average. According to him, the average minimum temperature in Kathmandu on January 6 is 2.2 degrees Celsius.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhakal added that although the minimum temperature has been steadily declining in recent days, there has been no significant fluctuation in maximum temperatures. In the Tarai/Madhes districts, maximum temperatures saw a slight rise yesterday due to sunny conditions. Fog continues to form in the Tarai districts during the morning, clearing gradually after noon, and similar conditions are likely to persist for the next few days, he said.</p>\n",

When cricket tournaments are held for months like festivals, they affect academic activities, from research to teaching. The agreement with CAN is nearing its end, and we are not in favour of extending it,\u201d the official told Onlinekhabar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, TU is prepared to allow one or two matches on a limited basis. \u201cWe may allow one or two games or events, but organising matches in a way that disrupts teaching and learning like a festival is not appropriate,\u201d the official said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, CAN has maintained that the issue should be resolved through mutual understanding among all stakeholders. CAN spokesperson Chumbi Lama said Nepali cricket belongs to everyone and that the problem should be addressed through dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCricket does not belong only to CAN; it belongs to the state as well. The history of TU Cricket Ground and CAN is almost the same, and Nepal\u2019s achievements in cricket have come from this very ground. TU has been positive so far. Therefore, CAN also believes that TU, CAN, and the Ministry of Sports should sit together and find a solution,\u201d Lama said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that if alternative grounds are arranged, CAN would not need to disturb TU. \u201cThe government is already making investments. Once an alternative ground is prepared, this issue will be resolved,\u201d he said.</p>\n",

While Washington has made bold statements about its role in the country\u2019s future, power dynamics on the ground appear far more complex, with the Chavista apparatus still firmly in control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand what is unfolding beyond official statements and breaking news headlines, <em>Onlinekhabar</em> spoke with <a href=\"https://ijnet.org/en/story/journalist-month-ana-mar%C3%ADa-rodr%C3%ADguez-braz%C3%B3n\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://ijnet.org/en/story/journalist-month-ana-mar%C3%ADa-rodr%C3%ADguez-braz%C3%B3n\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ana Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez Braz\u00f3n</a>, a senior Venezuelan journalist who has long covered conflict, politics, and religion in Latin America. Currently a correspondent for Colombia\u2019s leading daily <em>El Tiempo</em>, Rodr\u00edguez Braz\u00f3n offers a ground-level view of how ordinary Venezuelans are responding to the crisis, the state of repression inside the country, and the political scenarios that may emerge in the days ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this interview, she explains the current status of Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What can you tell us about the current situation on the ground in Caracas and other major Venezuelan cities following the U.S. strike?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The streets have remained virtually deserted due to fears that the repressive apparatus will imprison or kill citizens. People have formed long queues at supermarkets and pharmacies to buy essential products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How has the Venezuelan government apparatus responded after President Maduro\u2019s capture, and how are the country\u2019s military forces and security agencies reacting to the resulting leadership vacuum?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police forces, commanded by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, remain deployed across the streets, monitoring citizens to prevent protests against the regime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Supreme Court has named Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez as interim president. However, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that the United States will \u201crun\u201d Venezuela. Who appears to be in control at this moment?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this moment, without a doubt, Chavismo continues to control the country. It is unclear what President Trump\u2019s statement is based on or what its actual implications are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reports indicate that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife have landed in New York and may be taken to a U.S. detention centre. How serious are the drug and weapons charges the US is planning to file against Maduro?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicol\u00e1s Maduro faces charges of terrorism and drug trafficking, in addition to being considered a dictator. Since 2020, the United States has offered a $50 million reward for his capture. It should also be noted that Maduro is under investigation by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>International media suggest mixed reactions among the Venezuelan population. How are Venezuelan citizens reacting to the news of his capture?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citizens are happy about Maduro\u2019s capture, but they cannot celebrate. It is important to remember that Chavismo still controls power and the repressive apparatus. More than 900 political prisoners remain detained, many of them tortured and held incommunicado. Several are imprisoned in El Helicoide, which is often compared to Sednaya prison in Syria. Under these conditions, no one is going to take to the streets to celebrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How are ordinary Venezuelans interpreting the U.S. intervention? Do they view it as an occupation, a liberation, or something else?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do not see it as an intervention, but rather as a successful yet incomplete operation, because Chavismo remains in power. What Venezuelans want is for opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez to take office as president-elect, having won more than seven million votes. Gonz\u00e1lez is currently in exile due to persecution by the regime.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trump-moduro-1024x500-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577475\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In your opinion, what key events or provocations might have triggered this U.S. military action?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons. The United States had offered a reward for Maduro\u2019s capture. It also participated in several dialogue processes between Chavismo and the opposition, which Maduro repeatedly failed to honour. Additionally, during President Trump\u2019s first administration, the White House had already attempted to overthrow Maduro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some Venezuelans believe that President Trump\u2019s actions are not about restoring democracy but about exploiting Venezuela\u2019s oil resources. What political or economic motivations might lie behind such a large-scale U.S. operation?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, the United States has oil interests. In fact, it contributed significantly to the consolidation of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry after the first well was drilled in 1920. However, to claim that oil is the sole objective is to ignore the fact that Cuba has taken Venezuelan oil for years without payment. Several Caribbean nations also benefited from Venezuelan oil for a long time without oversight. Russia, China, and Iran have similarly taken advantage of Venezuela\u2019s resources and strategic geographic location. Therefore, this narrative is largely a Chavista argument against the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Which international reactions have stood out most to you, and how might they shape the next phase of developments in Venezuela?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the reactions have mainly come from the regime\u2019s traditional allies and accomplices, Nicaragua and Cuba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been the immediate humanitarian impact of these events, particularly regarding food supply, healthcare, and infrastructure?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been no immediate humanitarian impact. The country has not come to a halt. People are lining up at supermarkets mainly as a preventive measure to stock up on supplies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From your perspective, what are the possible scenarios for Venezuela\u2019s political future in the coming weeks and in the longer term?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is still too early to conclude. Many scenarios are possible. For now, it appears that the United States is proposing that Delcy Rodr\u00edguez maintain order while preparations are made for an orderly transition to democracy. Maduro stole the July 28, 2024, elections, which is widely acknowledged. A peaceful transition is the best possible outcome for the country.</p>\n",

Patients of cold-related ailments have been increasing with the dip in temperature in the districts, doctors said. Senior Physician of Koshi Hospital, Dr Roshan Khadka, said the number of patients has increased lately after the severe cold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is said that the biting cold creates imbalances in body temperature and impacts the blood circulation in the human body as well. &#8220;The blood vessels get shrink as the body temperature lowers in winter. This reduces blood supply to the head, resulting in a continuous headache,&#8221; Dr Khadka said. One of the main reasons behind the headache during the winter is dehydration in the human body, Dr Khadka added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the children develop sore eyes, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, breathing problems, and diarrhoea with the weather changes. Seasonal influenza is a type of virus infection, it is also called flu, and is transmitted through breathing. The flu affects the elderly, chronically ill, malnourished children, diabetic patients, high blood pressure and heart patients who are on regular medication. Doctors suggest that it is advisable to get vaccinated against influenza to avoid various types of viral infection.</p>\n",

This imbalance often develops silently, yet its impact on the heart and blood vessels can be serious. Understanding the warning signs and causes is the first step towards prevention and natural control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Dr Hemraj Koirala, who is a senior yoga and naturopathy physician and senior specialist in regenerative medicine, currently associated with Yogi Naraharinath Yoga and Naturopathy Hospital, Bharatpur, and Kathmandu University Yoga and Naturopathy Hospital, shares information related to cholesterol.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Warning signs you should not ignore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dyslipidemia does not always show clear symptoms in the early stages, but as it progresses, the body starts sending signals. These may include pain in the legs while walking or standing, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, frequent indigestion or acidity, disturbed sleep, dizziness, and cold sweats. Some people may feel their heart pounding even at rest, experience nausea or vomiting, notice swollen veins in the hands, legs, abdomen, or neck, or even faint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Important note: These symptoms often become more intense during physical exertion or periods of stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why does cholesterol rise?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several factors contribute to abnormal cholesterol levels. A family history of lipid disorders increases risk, as does advancing age, especially after 30. Postmenopausal women are particularly vulnerable. Excess body weight, abdominal fat, and a sedentary lifestyle play a major role, along with conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and chronic kidney or liver disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifestyle habits also matter. Smoking, excessive alcohol intake, overuse of medications, and diets rich in trans fats, saturated fats, and greasy foods significantly disturb lipid balance. In some cases, severe infections, digestive disorders, or sexually transmitted diseases can also contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why early awareness matters?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unchecked dyslipidemia increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and blocked arteries. The good news is that with timely awareness and natural lifestyle changes, cholesterol levels can often be brought under control before serious complications arise. Understanding your body\u2019s signals today can protect your heart tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The condition in which the levels of blood lipids such as total cholesterol, chylomicrons, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides are higher or lower than normal is medically known as dyslipidemia. Let&#8217;s explore natural ways to reduce cholesterol. These symptoms tend to worsen during physical exertion and stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Natural treatment measures:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Weight reduction</strong>: People who are overweight are more prone to dyslipidemia. Maintaining an ideal body weight according to height is essential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Regular physical exercise</strong>: A sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of dyslipidemia. Making physical exercise part of a daily routine is important. Regular exercise increases HDL cholesterol and reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. At least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily or five days a week helps control dyslipidemia effectively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fasting</strong>: Fasting is considered a highly effective remedy for dyslipidemia. Among various methods, intermittent fasting, fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window, is considered simple and practical. Proper fasting helps reduce high blood cholesterol levels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adequate intake of fruits and green vegetables</strong>: To control cholesterol, it is recommended to consume five types of fruits daily, equivalent to one per cent of body weight, divided into two servings. For example, a person weighing 70 kg should consume about 700 grams of fruits at around 9 am and again at around 3 pm.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adopting zero-oil cooking methods</strong>: Excessive intake of oil, ghee, fat, fish, meat, and eggs is a major cause of high cholesterol. Those aiming to reduce cholesterol should adopt oil-free cooking methods. For healthy fat requirements, nuts and seeds such as cashews, almonds, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and coconut should be consumed. Individuals with high cholesterol and triglycerides should avoid oil, ghee, and animal-based fats such as cheese, paneer, butter, fish, meat, and eggs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quitting smoking</strong>: Dyslipidemia is common among smokers. Smoking increases bad cholesterol (LDL) and reduces good cholesterol (HDL). It also increases oxidation of LDL cholesterol, damaging the inner lining of blood vessels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoiding alcohol:</strong> Alcohol consumption commonly leads to dyslipidemia. It increases triglycerides and lowers HDL cholesterol. Alcohol also damages the liver and heart muscles, adversely affecting overall health.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoiding sugar and refined carbohydrates</strong>: People with dyslipidemia should avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates, as these stimulate the liver to produce more cholesterol.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoiding trans fats and hydrogenated fats:</strong> Hydrogenated fats, commonly known as vanaspati or dalda ghee, and trans fats found in animal-based foods increase lipid imbalance and raise the risk of heart and blood vessel diseases. Repeated frying of oils converts natural fats into harmful trans fats.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consuming fibre-rich foods</strong>: Adequate intake of fibre helps prevent heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and digestive disorders. It also helps correct lipid imbalance by lowering triglycerides and LDL cholesterol while increasing HDL cholesterol. Both soluble and insoluble fibres bind bile acids in the intestine and promote their excretion through stool. As bile acids are lost repeatedly, the liver uses more blood cholesterol to produce new bile acids, thereby reducing blood cholesterol levels.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Intake of omega-3 fatty acids</strong>: Omega-3 fatty acids significantly help reduce triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consumption of garlic</strong>: Garlic has been traditionally used as a lipid-lowering agent. It helps reduce triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, and blood pressure. Phytochemicals present in garlic inhibit cholesterol synthesis and prevent LDL oxidation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consumption of fenugreek:</strong> Regular consumption of fenugreek helps lower blood cholesterol. It increases the number of LDL receptors in cells, and its compound 4-hydroxyisoleucine reduces fat accumulation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consumption of ginger:</strong> A 2018 study showed that consuming 5 grams of ginger daily reduced LDL cholesterol by up to 17.4 per cent within three months.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use of medicinal herbs</strong>: Various herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda such as garlic, fenugreek, ginger, triphala (harro, barro, amla), guggul, arjuna, basil, turmeric, green tea, flaxseed, guduchi, bitter gourd, amla, neem, ginseng, banana seeds, and cinnamon help effectively reduce cholesterol.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consumption of rice bran oil:</strong> Rice bran oil helps lower blood cholesterol. It contains 38 per cent monounsaturated fat, 37 per cent polyunsaturated fat, and 25 per cent saturated fat. It is also rich in antioxidants like gamma-oryzanol, vitamin E, and phytosterols. Consumption of rice bran oil has been found to reduce bad cholesterol, increase good cholesterol, and lower triglycerides.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stress management:</strong> Mental stress can increase cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Therefore, stress management is essential while working to reduce cholesterol.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Drinking adequate water</strong>: Insufficient water intake can contribute to cholesterol problems. To prevent high cholesterol, one should drink adequate water and consume water-rich fruits and vegetables, as well as green tea.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The exhibition runs from January 1 to January 5, 2026, and is open to the public on the ground and first floors of the gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Synthesis</em> presents the culmination of four years of sustained artistic practice by graduating students, reflecting their individual inquiries as well as shared academic and creative experiences. The exhibition offers insight into the evolving artistic journeys of the students, highlighting how their ideas, processes, and expressions have developed over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceptualised as a collaborative effort, the exhibition brings together diverse practices, materials, and perspectives within a unified curatorial framework. While each work reflects a distinct personal exploration, the collective presentation emphasises dialogue and interaction among the artworks, creating a cohesive visual and conceptual narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The title <em>Synthesis</em> underscores the integration of varied artistic approaches into a shared space, acknowledging diversity while fostering collective meaning. Moving beyond the academic context, the exhibition seeks to engage the wider art community and general audience, encouraging reflection, exchange, and connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring works by 36 graduating artists, the exhibition contributes to ongoing conversations within contemporary art practices in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BFA Exhibition 2026 stands as both a milestone for the emerging artists and a platform for public engagement with new creative voices.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\"

Born in Caracas in 1962, he rose from a working-class background, becoming politically active through labour unions while working as a metro driver. His alignment with late Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in the 1990s firmly placed him within the anti-imperialist and socialist political current known as the Bolivarian Revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As foreign minister under Ch\u00e1vez, Maduro became a vocal critic of US foreign policy, defending Venezuela\u2019s control over strategic resources such as oil and expanding ties with Cuba, Russia, and China. After Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death in 2013, Maduro assumed the presidency, inheriting both the revolutionary legacy and an increasingly hostile relationship with Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United States has since imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Venezuela, targeting its oil trade, financial sector, and international transactions. While Washington has described these measures as necessary to restore democracy, the Maduro government has repeatedly labelled them an \u201ceconomic war,\u201d blaming US pressure for the country\u2019s deep economic crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tensions escalated further in 2019 when the US and several Western countries recognised opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president, a move Caracas denounced as an attempted coup. Since then, allegations of plots to overthrow Maduro, foreign interference, and attempts to control Venezuelan assets abroad have persisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a dramatic development, the United States is claimed to have launched a military operation in Venezuela, detaining President Maduro and transferring him to New York. US President Donald Trump was quoted as saying that the US would oversee Venezuela\u2019s governance until a \u201csafe and responsible\u201d transfer of power takes place. Images allegedly showing Maduro in US custody were shared on social media platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to several reports, US authorities plan to prosecute Maduro in a federal court in New York on charges including narcotics trafficking and conspiracy, allegations Venezuela has long rejected as politically motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reported military action has drawn condemnation from Russia, China, and Colombia, all of which warned that unilateral military intervention violates the United Nations Charter. Meanwhile, Venezuelan officials have demanded proof of Maduro\u2019s condition and accused foreign forces of carrying out the largest attack the country has ever faced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, independent verification of the claims remains unclear. For supporters, Maduro represents resistance against foreign domination; for critics, he embodies authoritarian rule and economic mismanagement. What is undeniable is that Venezuela has once again become a focal point of a broader geopolitical struggle, with implications far beyond its borders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

This year marks a global jubilation for rewarding the underdogs for their best. Resilience, perseverance, and discipline have been the mantras for the sportspersons and teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams not only lifted the trophy, but they also lifted the hope of unity, fairness, and countless lessons to pursue a goal with utmost dedication. This year, women in sports have set remarkable footprints that have inspired millions to work relentlessly to reach their highest potential. Despite the landmarks, the sports lovers have triumphed in victory across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The beginning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In January, Denmark became the first nation to win four consecutive world titles in the International Handball Federation Championship. Brazil and Egypt made it to the quarterfinals for the first time in 26 years as non-European teams. Super Bowl LIX (USA) is one of the most-watched sporting events globally. According to Forbes, due to the &#8220;Taylor Swift Effect,&#8221; a record 47.5% of Super Bowl viewers were female last year. Viewing among females aged 18 to 24 increased by 24% year over year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entertainment and sports combination is often considered a global hit. The growth of the female audience in sports is quite remarkable. After 12 years, India, being unbeaten in all games, lifted the International Cricket Council Champions Trophy in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rohit Sharma scored 76 off 83 deliveries, winning him Player of the Match, making history as the first captain to do so in an ICC Champions Trophy final. On March 16, 2025, Newcastle United won over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup after 70 years. Team stability and clinical performance led the title their way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From potential to glory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2025, during the clay court tennis season, with explosive footwork and relentless topspin, young Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz quickly became a dominant presence on clay courts, and Iga Swiatek is considered the queen of clay. Both of them emerged as young players and new stars in the making. In May, Crystal Palace, with a stunning 1-0 win over Manchester City, won their first title in the Football Association in 120 years, known as the Emirates FA Cup, which is the world&#8217;s oldest football competition, where the team evolved into a beast in the finals through their composure and dedication. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On May 25, 2025, Tottenham Hotspur clinched the Europa League cup 1-0 against Manchester United after 17 years. The side executed the plans accordingly and maintained composure in the big final. On May 31, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) became 5-0 victorious against Inter Milan in the Union of European Football Associations Champions League, which is their first-ever title and is not a fluke but a tactical brilliance in the league. Similarly, the most decorated football player of our generation, Harry Kane, finally won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, his first trophy, at the age of 31, breaking the &#8220;curse.&#8221; A club legend\u2019s story portrays that patience with dedication is the key. Sometimes delay is not denial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Crowning moments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 3, 2025, the most celebrated win of the Royal Challengers Bangalore against the Punjab Kings in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League reinvigorated the fans across the borders. The 18th really brought a miracle for Virat Kohli, who is a legend of cricket, and a trophy drought is over as he received his maiden Indian Premier League Trophy; through his perseverance and resilience came the fairytale moment. This season marks the greatest achievements of Kohli himself, as he dedicated his teens, youth, and expertise to this franchise. The fanbase has reached its greatest height. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arika Gurung made Nepal proud by clinching a gold medal at the Australian Open Karate Championship 2025. On June 3, 2025, she made history by winning Nepal\u2019s first-ever bronze at the Karate-1 Premier League in Rabat, Morocco. This is the victory of her self-belief, confidence, and perseverance. She is truly an inspiration for all of us. She has definitely inspired young girls to pursue a career in sports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 14, 2025, South Africa, after 27 years, finally recorded the International Cricket Council trophy by being victorious in the World Test Championship against the mighty Australia, which rarely loses the finals. This moment symbolises the grit of a new generation who are unbothered by the past and are on the way to redefine the global narrative of the South African cricket team. In July, the 2025 Tour de France, a landmark cycling event, highlighted dramatic racing and breathtaking performances across the French mountains and valleys, where Tadej Poga\u010dar entered the elite discussions among the greatest cyclists of all time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fresh starts, new stakes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2025 World Aquatics Championships in August showcased the grand aquatic championship for the first time in Singapore. L\u00e9on Marchand and Summer McIntosh hold their golden medals with their luminous victories. The political uprising of September 22 and 23, the Gen Z movement, created turmoil in Nepal; disappointment and frustration were all among the people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 29, 2025 the calm breeze came in place after Nepal sealed a 2-0 victory against the test-playing nation West Indies in a T20I bilateral series at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. At that moment, the victory was not just a mere game. It was metaphorical to glance at the zeal of the players; a thin layer of unity and hope was for the young generation. There was something to cherish after a miserable week, and that was a cricket.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The long grind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 19, 2025, the Denver Broncos achieved one of the most surprising comebacks in the National Football League against the New York Giants. They scored 33 points in a single quarter after being shut out for the first three quarters, winning 33\u201332 with a last-second field goal. This marks the modern-day miracle comeback by a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 2, 2025, the Indian Women&#8217;s Cricket team claimed their maiden trophy by winning against South Africa by 52 runs. Shefali Verma sealed the player of the match, where she was a replacement opener. She comes from Rohtak, a rural part of India, where girls were not recognised as cricketers. She cut her hair short and joined a team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, her runs came for a winning cause, and her father became a backbone for her success. This World Win is the Girls&#8217; Win for equality, empowerment, and social functioning. Each woman&#8217;s story is so poignant that it has inspired the upcoming generation to become Shefali Verma, Harmanpreet Kaur, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Smriti Mandhana, and the Indian Women\u2019s team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 23, 2025, Nepali girls waved the Nepali flag on a global stage by reaching the finals of the inaugural Blind Women\u2019s T20 Cricket World Cup. Though Nepal could not claim the inaugural title against India by 7 wickets. It is a moment of immense respect for the women in a country like ours to overcome the social stigma and represent the country despite the countless hardships. The girls reminded us to pursue a goal with strong determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The showdown</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 13, 2025, the Hobart Hurricanes Women won their first-ever Women&#8217;s Big Bash League, where the Hobart Hurricanes won their maiden title in the Big Bash League at the beginning of the year. The men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s teams winning the title at the sunrise and sunset of the year is definitely poetry in motion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the same day, the Nepal Premier League, in its second season, witnessed a \u2018miracle\u2019 where the Lumbini Lions concluded the finals after a triumph against the Sudur Paschim Royals by 6 wickets. The previous year, Lumbini Lions were at the bottom of the table, and most spectators wrote off the team in this season too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The passionate beliefs of fans to win the title even after losing the first three games in a row. The underdog team&#8217;s journey was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride. After losing in a row, each game was a knockout for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their game plan best fits with a Nepali saying: &#8220;Stay grounded in both suffering and success.&#8221; The calm-headed captain, Rohit Kumar Paudel, led the unit with his composure. A hat trick at the big finals, Player of the Tournament, and Best Batter is the legacy of the Captain. In sports, the prevailing notion is that a captain is as good as the team. Sher Malla, Darcy Short, Niroshan Dickwella, and each team member, coach, and staff member are equal shareholders of the win. This team has consistently demonstrated strength in tactics, resilience in adversity, redemption, and perseverance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, the year 2025 would be etched in history as a year of &#8216;miracle,&#8217; in which unfulfilled dreams were finally fulfilled, characterised by resilience and redemption, emerging as a saga of underdogs. This year marks a milestone for women in sports, redefining excellence and grit and radiating with moments that will be sung for generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Despite these realities, multiple private colleges in Nepal have marketed their institutional branding and MOUs with international companies as a determining factor in hiring decisions for their graduates in both local and foreign job markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there is a false assumption among colleges in Nepal that opportunities for jobs in a particular sector in a foreign country result in employability across other sectors of the economy in that country. For example, opportunities for hospitality internships in Japan, Malaysia, or the UAE for Nepali students do not mean that tech companies or other businesses in those countries can or will recruit interns from different knowledge domains and specialisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, before making claims about international job prospects, private colleges need to critically evaluate whether their curricula, teaching quality, infrastructure, and graduate competencies align with the ever-changing dynamics of the international labour market and the global system of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid claims based on misleading MOUs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue is that private colleges associated with hospitality management, business administration, engineering, internet technology, and computer sciences in Nepal advertise Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with both national and international companies as proof of guaranteed internships and career pathways for their graduates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These advertisements mislead school/+2 graduates who have limited access to independent career counselling and job-market information into believing that they will get internship and job opportunities in these industries. Hence, when private colleges present non-exclusive MOUs as guarantees of internships and employment, school graduates interpret these claims as assurances for their future job stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas in reality, the tech companies or hospitality industries sign MOUs with multiple private colleges and foreign university partners for their own network expansions, business strategy, and promotional purposes. Besides, these MOUs are non-binding documents, and they do not assure internship opportunities, job placement, or employment outcomes during or after graduation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, thousands of students from multiple private colleges with similar specializations compete for limited internships, of which only a few graduates get selected based on skill competence and placement availability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this competitive reality with limited job opportunities, colleges market their partnership with tech companies and the hospitality industries as if their graduates have exclusive access to these reputed national and international companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As students and their parents have already invested time, future and high fees for the degree based on misleading information, and when job expectations turn into bitter neglect, emotions of angst, anxiety, and distress of students spill all over social networking sites. More importantly, when the narratives of betrayal reflected in these social media posts become viral, they tarnish the image of an institution and create confusion and fear among prospective high school/Plus 2 graduates who want to pursue their higher education in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus on professional and employability skills development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than relying on exaggerated promises or false claims about international internships, exclusive local industry tie-ups, collaborative projects, or guaranteed job opportunities after graduation, higher education institutions in Nepal need to focus on developing the core employability skills of their students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher education needs to equip its learners with critical thinking dispositions, problem-solving ability, teamwork, professional communication, networking skills, technical competence, ample industrial exposure, and understanding of corporate culture, which enables them to find employment opportunities both in the local market and in international companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, our colleges need to acknowledge that their graduates are not as passive recipients who are incompetent to find job placements without their support. Our colleges need to reimagine their graduates as grown-up adults with sufficient self-efficacy, independent learning competence, and creative confidence who can competently navigate highly complex career pathways and a competitive job market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond grades, exams, and theoretical knowledge, our university system and private colleges must emphasise the mastery of both technical and interpersonal skills through project-based learning, industry exposure, experiential field visits, interactive sessions with industry experts, workshops, applied problem-solving assignments, and practical case studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private colleges also need to focus on co-curricular and extra-curricular activities that support professional skill development that aligns with industrial needs. Here, private colleges need to focus on building their credibility through the employability skills and employment outcomes of their graduates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, private colleges in Nepal need to empower students with lifelong learning habits and networking skills so that they can independently seek and create employment opportunities nationally and internationally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, colleges, rather than making false claims, fake social media advertisements, and misleading promises that undermine student agency and diminish public trust, need to commit themselves to honest communication about employment opportunities with their graduates and focus on skill-centred education for their sustainable employment outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

She gave birth to a daughter, but Manita passed away before she could even see her daughter&#8217;s face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subash is suspicious about the cause of the death.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0\u201cMy wife died due to medical negligence,\u201d he says to <a href=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"english.onlinekhabar.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Onlinekhabar</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clutching all available medical documents, Subash has been running from office to office seeking answers about his wife\u2019s death. But his demands for justice have remained unheeded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis whole year I spent seeking justice, I clearly understood the disorder within the health sector,\u201d Subash says. \u201cThe powerful people of the institutions I reached out to seek justice caused me trouble.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happened?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident occurred on December 11, 2024. At around 1:00 PM, the 41-year-old Manita experienced severe pain in the upper part of her abdomen. She was 34 weeks pregnant at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the pain, Manita panicked and tried calling Dr Jyotsna Sharma, but it went unanswered. Manita had been under Dr Jyotsna\u2019s regular consultation, and the doctor had told her to call immediately if any problem arose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming the doctor was busy, Manita sent an SMS, \u201cDoctor, please pick up the phone. I\u2019m in extreme pain. Where should I come?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manita\u2019s first pregnancy had ended in miscarriage at five months. The couple was very cautious this time. Fearing something might happen to the baby, Subash and Manita headed toward the hospital while continuously trying to call the doctor, but received no response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Parajuli couple had been undergoing checkups at Everest Hospital in New Baneshwor. However, based on Dr Jyotsna\u2019s advice, they had chosen Kathmandu Medical College (KMC) in Sinamangal for delivery due to convenience and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Jyotsna works at both Kathmandu Medical College and Everest Hospital. After the couple entered KMC, Dr Jyotsna finally called and instructed them to come to Everest Hospital instead, assuring that she would also come there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They rushed to Everest Hospital.<br><br>\u201cEven after waiting for hours in the emergency room, Dr Jyotsna did not arrive,\u201d Subash recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the emergency room, Manita underwent an ultrasound and blood tests. Her blood pressure was 180/120, which is extremely high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After nearly two hours, Dr Jyotsna arrived.<br><br>\u201cWhen we saw her, our confidence level became very high,\u201d Subash says. \u201cBut without any consultation with us, my wife was taken upstairs for surgery.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some time, surgery was performed. Manita gave birth to a daughter. However, her condition did not improve, and her blood pressure remained high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subash questioned the doctor, \u201cHow could you perform surgery when her blood pressure was so high?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Jyotsna replied that medication had normalised the blood pressure before surgery, but it rose again after the baby was delivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after, Subash heard Dr Jyotsna repeatedly calling out \u201cManita, Manita, Manita\u2026\u201d from outside. The doctor then informed him that Manita had developed seizures and had been given medication, and that she might need to be shifted to the ICU if her condition did not improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seizures occurring after childbirth, characterised by sudden convulsions, unconsciousness, and body stiffness, are known as postpartum preeclampsia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manita was quickly shifted to the ICU. Subash followed, but by then Dr Jyotsna had already left the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe pain she had when we first came to the hospital did not subside even after the baby was delivered,\u201d Subash says tearfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 1:30 PM on December 11, Manita\u2019s condition worsened to the point that CPR had to be performed. Subash says that reports from 10 AM and noon had already indicated problems, but the hospital never informed him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI trusted the doctor and took my wife to Everest Hospital because we had decided two years ago to deliver under Dr Jyotsna\u2019s supervision,\u201d Subash says. \u201cBut once her condition became critical, they told us to refer her to another hospital.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only then were they told that her liver had failed and her kidneys were also affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Dr Jyotsna\u2019s advice, the family decided to take Manita to HAMS Hospital. At HAMS, doctors revealed that she had already developed HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia during pregnancy, conditions that cause blood-clotting issues and liver damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Manita was placed on a ventilator.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors told the family, \u201cOrgans that have already failed cannot be restored. We can only try to prevent further deterioration.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All efforts failed. After seven days on the ventilator, Manita passed away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe never got even a moment with the daughter she gave birth to,\u201d Subash says. \u201cBy the time we reached HAMS, it was already too late. Due to medical negligence, she left the world within days.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The harassment Subash faced</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing Manita\u2019s funeral rites, Subash learned from HAMS doctors that the complications could have been avoided with proper treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He consulted several doctors he knew and eventually decided to pursue a legal battle for medical negligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf proper treatment had been given on time, this situation would never have arisen,\u201d Subash says. \u201cThe doctor neither informed us during treatment nor during follow-ups. Instead, she left an ICU patient and walked away.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He adds that after preeclampsia, magnesium sulfate must be administered immediately, often called a life-saving drug. Manita did not receive it in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subash requested treatment records and wrote applications to Everest Hospital seeking clarification on the cause of death, but received no response. He also requested preservation of CCTV footage, only to be told that no footage existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then approached the <a href=\"https://www.nmc.org.np/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nmc.org.np/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nepal Medical Council</a>, filing a complaint on February 11 2025, alleging gross negligence by the treating doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Council officials told him a decision would be made within three months. He also went to the Ministry of Health, but officials redirected him back to the Council, saying it was not under their jurisdiction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months passed with no hearing. Every few weeks, Subash would visit the Council. Sometimes he was told expert opinions had not yet been taken; other times, that investigations were ongoing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friends warned him, \u201cThe Council exists to protect doctors. Ordinary people never get justice there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Subash continued knocking on the doors of the council.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Shocking Decision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On September 8, 2025, Subash received the Council\u2019s decision by email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cSince all treatments were conducted according to guidelines, no negligence or carelessness is observed,\u201d the mail reads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The email shocked Subash, and he immediately replied to the email, requesting a review. He later filed a formal review application, arguing that the decision was one-sided and ignored evidence he had submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying his infant daughter, he continued visiting the Council. Officials kept redirecting him to one another. He claims that even two months later, Council Chair Dr Chopalal Bhusal refused to endorse the review application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, on October 18, 2025, after relentless effort, the application was forwarded to the Professional Conduct Committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen victims go seeking justice, they are instead subjected to further suffering,\u201d Subash says. \u201cCouncil officials will go to any extent to protect doctors.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Divided expert opinions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"542\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nepal-Medical-Council-NMC-768x542-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577454\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Suvash\u2019s case, the Ethics Committee sought opinions from five experts. The third expert clearly identified medical negligence, citing failure to properly manage high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and delayed administration of magnesium sulfate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite this, the conclusions were identical, apparently copied and pasted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to high-level Council sources, after one expert identified negligence, two more experts were added.<br><br>\u201cThe investigation does not appear deep or impartial,\u201d the source says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ethics Committee itself did not issue any conclusion, and the full Council meeting made the decision solely based on expert reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Allegations of abuse of power</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Subash alleges that the Council, established to regulate doctors and ensure justice, is instead protecting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further alleges that Dr Jyotsna\u2019s husband, Dr Sanjiv Tiwari, the General Secretary of the Nepal Medical Association, abused his influence to protect his wife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subash claims hospital administration backed off from providing documents after receiving calls from the Association.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Tiwari, however, denies all allegations, stating that he neither interfered nor influenced the case and is ready to face any action if proven otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning to the courts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After losing hope in the Medical Council, Subash has knocked on the doors of the judiciary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have now approached the Consumer Court. The investigation is ongoing,\u201d he says. \u201cIf justice exists in this country, I will get it, even if I have to go up to the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The truck (PB 02 BR 7765) had hit the scooter (Pr 1\u201301\u2013013 P 5888) while she was on the way from Kakadbhitta to Birtamod. Information officer at the District Police Office, Khagendra Bahadur Khadka, shared that Saha, a local of Mechinagar\u20136, was critically injured in the accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was immediately taken to Mechi AMDA Hospital in Dhulabari for treatment, where the doctors declared her dead, Khadka further informed. The police took control of 36-year-old truck driver Sandeep Singh from Punjab, India, and held him at the local police office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public has complained about the distress caused due to the haphazard diversion on the under-construction Asian Highway and the uneven road. On the evening of December 20, 2025, two young people died in a motorcycle accident at a diversion near Buttawari Tea Garden in Birtamod\u20136. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The public has also complained about not properly placing and maintaining diversion and signposts, and the unmanaged road conditions on the Kankadbhitta\u2013Birtamod section along the highway. Journalist Sabitra Dahal from Kankai-6 and Evan Luintel from Mechinagar-9 said that they met with an accident on the highway due to poor diversion. Dahal and Luintel have recently returned home after recovering their health following a long hospital stay</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Following the interim government formed under Prime Minister Sushila Karki, public discourse across the country has centred on a pressing question: who will lead \u2018Nepal\u2019 next, and can they finally deliver the real changes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an NRN woman, I have worked with several NGOs and INGOs operating in Nepal. My perspective on the coalition of the big three, namely Balen Shah, Rabi Lamichhane, and Kul Man Ghising, is shaped by lived experiences with family-led initiatives, engagement with educational institutions, and direct exposure to the realities faced by Nepalis both at home and overseas. So, it&#8217;s time to understand the challenges that the country is facing, and with the &#8216;Big 3&#8217;, there is this question: could they deliver what the country is hoping for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an NRN woman, I have worked with several NGOs and INGOs operating in Nepal. My perspective on the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/united-rabi-balen-and-kulman.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Big Three</a>\u201d, Balen Shah, Rabi Lamichhane, and Kul Man Ghising, is shaped by lived experience through family-led initiatives, engagement with educational institutions, and direct exposure to the realities faced by Nepalis both at home and abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this moment, it is important to clearly understand the challenges the country is facing. With the emergence of the \u201cBig Three,\u201d a key question remains: can they deliver what the country is hoping for?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A nation caught between fatigue and fear</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nepali diaspora, particularly Gen-Z members, remains concerned about the possible return of the government that was previously overthrown. While some politicians have expressed remorse, others continue to seek power without addressing the needs of the Nepali people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole point of the Gen-Z revolution was for a \u2018New Nepal\u2019. With former politicians returning to power, will remains counter-productive and remains a widespread concern within Nepal as well as across the diaspora.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against this backdrop of instability and public fatigue, remarkably, the three new trailblazers of change have formed a coalition between the Mayor of Kathmandu, Balen Shah; the founder of Rastriya Swantra Party, Rabi Lamichhane; and engineering pioneer and former Managing Director of Nepal Electricity Authority and currently a minister in the interim government, Kul Man Ghising. With this occurring, Nepalis across the globe are hoping for a \u2018New Nepal\u2019. All of them, even with criticism, are notoriously known for always favouring public interest over personal economic gain. It is evident in the work they have done for the Nepali people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The emergence of Nepal\u2019s \u2018Big Three\u2019</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, they are known as the Icons of Nepal due to their impressive careers in public service. Balen Shah (Mayor of Kathmandu) was the first mayor to win the Kathmandu election as an Independent. As a mayor, he has accomplished tremendous work in his short time in office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, the main thing he improved was Nepal&#8217;s urban cleanliness and the enhancement of Kathmandu&#8217;s infrastructure. He enforced rules and reclaimed footpaths and roads that had been neglected in Kathmandu for several decades. It was commendable how, within a few years, he changed the landscape of Kathmandu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rabi Lamichhane (Founder of RSP &amp; Investigative Journalist) has been at the pinnacle of journalism and politics, exposing deep-rooted corruption in Nepal that has persisted for centuries. He made the voice of ordinary Nepalis heard by using live TV without any editing, to be as transparent with the public as possible. He has always been the voice of unvoiced Nepali, especially working under inhuman working conditions around the Middle East and as a journalist, he has rescued 100s of poor Nepali workers from abroad. Lamichhane is regarded as the most famous amongst the politicians and has successfully delivered his tenure as an honest home minister of Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kul Man Ghising has been an extraordinary figure in Nepal&#8217;s engineering fraternity, as he was the one who ended load-shedding that had impacted Nepali people for many decades. I remember my parents mentioning that seeing light for more than 5 hours in a day was a miracle, and that he ended darkness from the country during his years in office as managing director of Nepal Engineering Authority by taking bold risks with maximum outcomes. Ghising also gets the credit for bringing electricity to over 97% of the Nepali population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of them allying, it powerfully highlights the vision of a \u2018New Nepal\u2019. They are widely recognised for prioritising public interest over personal gain and for resisting the exploitation of resources that have long hidden our beautiful country. Their credibility is shown in the tangible work they have delivered to the Nepali people (Balen Shah: Infrastructure development and law enforcement; Rabi Lamichhane: Exposing corruption and creating RSP; Kul Man Ghising: Ending load shedding and leading development of new Nepal. Through their hard work, they have delivered to the Nepali people and earned their trust, and in my opinion, they are the most credible path towards the \u2018New Nepal\u2019, the country we all seek religiously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Nepal&#8217;s meaning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does the \u2019New Nepal\u2019 actually mean? We have seen in recent times that there are several interpretations and meanings, and everyone&#8217;s perspective is distinct due to different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who is trying to split her time between Nepal and London, the \u2018New Nepal\u2019 looks like a Nepal where young people don&#8217;t leave just because they no longer have a choice. I no longer want to see young adults forced to flee their country of new hopes and crying at the airport, not knowing how their journey would look like and when they may next see their family. From working for my family charity, Subodh Foundation UK, and assisting my dad at \u2018Society of Nepali Engineers in UK,\u2019 I have come to realise that in recent years, Many Nepalis have only come for financial gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps their hearts belong to Nepal. It has been a common theme among many in the Nepali diaspora: the highlight of their years is their trip to Nepal. This phenomenon highlights how NRN&#8217;s deep love for Nepal. So, as a twenty-three-year-old girl in the airport, seeing young adults of her age leave the country for work and education, it becomes disheartening for me, as I realise it&#8217;s out of necessity, not out of want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that, according to Nepali time, roughly 700,000 people left the country in 2023? That is an alarming figure. So, it&#8217;s a must that \u2018New Nepal\u2019 now focuses on young people&#8217;s needs, or else Nepal may risk becoming a country with no young workforce. This wouldn&#8217;t mean not having social stagnation, but also a dying economy with no workforce to sustain its future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, and perhaps most importantly at this time, the \u2018New Nepal\u2019 must be led by individuals who prioritise the interests of the Nepali people over personal gain. For nearly two decades, the role of prime minister has changed frequently (As an outsider, it feels like the game of \u2018Musical chairs\u2019). In the context of international politics, such instability appears unusual and undermines effective governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reflects a broader range of consequences stemming from Nepal being consistently treated as an inferior nation and may affect how Nepal is perceived internationally, which, in turn, would impact trade and investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several politicians and ministers have compared promised Nepal with Switzerland and Singapore on multiple occasions; they persistently sold fake dreams with no follow-up. Hence, the excitement of the significant three combining forces has excited the Nepali diaspora across the world, as they have shown action on their vision, which is the most vital tool for a New Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fundamentally, all Gen-Z want the New Nepal to have leaders who are trailblazers, who create jobs, empower the youth, and don&#8217;t make blanket statements with no follow-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lessons for history and risk ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout history, the formation of alliances has been a strategic move in political conflicts. During World War II, the concept of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; emerged, involving the British leader Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt of the USA, and Joseph Stalin of the USSR. This alliance was instrumental in their combined efforts to overthrow the Nazis during the 1940s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, like any relationship, the coalition did in fact collapse in 1945. Hence, it is vital to recognise that Nepal\u2019s big three (Balen Shah, Rabi Lamichhane &amp; Kul Man Ghising) could collapse in the future. Still, as of this moment, their alliance is the most essential to rebuilding public trust, extinguishing the idea of corruption, and creating a new face of Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all want real change for Nepal, and having leaders like Balen Shah, Rabi Lamichhane, and Kul Man Ghising is a step towards anticipated changes. These leaders actually get implementation done, leading to the economic prosperity and infrastructure development prioritising Nepal desperately needs. That&#8217;s why the Nepali diaspora worldwide is thrilled about the Big Three teaming up. They&#8217;ve proven that they take action on their vision, which is crucial for building a \u2018New Nepal\u2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Balen Shah has played a monumental role in transforming Kathmandu&#8217;s infrastructural development. A notable project he spearheaded was the revitalisation of the Tukucha River, turning a neglected area into a vibrant public space that significantly improved local livelihoods. He also implemented a rule-based urban management approach by launching the &#8220;Clean City Initiative,&#8221; which enforced stricter waste management regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His collaboration with youth volunteers to clear the streets of Kathmandu led to the removal of over 1,000 tons of waste within a year. Furthermore, Shah has made it a priority to reclaim over 200 acres of public land that had been encroached upon, setting a precedent for urban management in Nepal. These innovative actions had never been undertaken before his leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Rabi Lamichhane, during his time as a deputy prime minister and home minister, initiated a significant anti-smuggling campaign called &#8216;Project Safe Border.&#8217; Through this initiative, he implemented stricter border controls and introduced advanced surveillance technologies to intercept illegal goods. This policy not only reduced the decades-long smuggling operations that had plagued Nepal but also restored trust in government operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Rabi actively advocated for the rights of Nepali citizens from less elite backgrounds, becoming a vocal representative for their issues. His time abroad as a non-resident Nepali has given him a unique perspective, allowing him to deeply understand and empathise with the diaspora&#8217;s unwavering love for their homeland. Lamichhane has successfully delivered this supreme leadership quality by successfully establishing his lead political party (RSP) as the 4<sup>th</sup> National party within a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, Kul Man Ghising has solved Nepal&#8217;s load shedding, which had been a nightmare. He implemented several strategic measures to address the issue, including increasing the capacity of existing power plants, importing electricity from India during peak demand, and optimising electricity supply and demand. He also focused on improving the efficiency of the power distribution network. The fact that he spent all his holiday during Tihar operating and understanding electricity shows his dedication to his goal of making Nepal prosper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything I have mentioned, all their achievements, is a testament to the proactive and results-driven approach of these leaders. They have consistently reached out to the Nepali people, understanding and addressing their needs. Unlike past leaders, whose strategies often revolved around bureaucracy and stagnation, Balen Shah, Rabi Lamichhane, and Kul Man Ghising have adopted innovative measures and decisive actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This distinction and dedication explain why Nepalis around the world are excited for a \u2018New Nepal\u2019. While these leaders have effectively addressed the pressing needs of the average Nepali citizen, many past leaders struggled to align their policies with the people&#8217;s aspirations, often failing to meet the fundamental requirements of progress and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What remains to be discussed and seen is whether the big three will uphold the expectations the Nepali diaspora has of them. Having three prominent personalities can be incredible, especially Balen, Rabi, and Kul Man, working together, as they each hold significant roles and have different skill sets that can create a prosperous Nepal. Balen Shah, as the Mayor of Kathmandu, brings his visionary leadership to urban development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rabi Lamichhane, a notable media personality and a fresh political figure, offers a powerful voice for change. Kulman Ghising, renowned for his tenure as a successful and crucial revolutioniser for Nepal&#8217;s energy sector. Still, if there is a dis-alignment, it can repeat what has occurred in Nepal previously: the oscillation of the prime minister, which means the idea of New Nepal would become extinct. However, there is a strong reason for optimism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wholeheartedly believe that history will not repeat itself and that the Nepali diaspora will no longer see musical chairs in the prime minister&#8217;s position, as the new upcoming politicians and the Big Three have demonstrated their deep understanding of the Nepali people&#8217;s needs and their commitment to public service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strongly believe and duly hope that the new year 2026 will bring new sunshine to new and prosperous Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

As reported by the National Trust for Nature Conservation, Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP) Jomsom, there were 25,403 additional foreign tourists in 2025 compared to 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, tourist arrivals have increased by 18.71 per cent from the previous year, totalling 161,122 foreign visitors from January to December 31, according to Rajesh Gupta, head of the ACAP Jomsom office. In 2024, Mustang welcomed 135,719 foreign tourists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the visitors last year, 132,847 hailed from SAARC countries, while 28,275 were from other regions. In contrast, the previous year saw 109,549 foreign tourists from SAARC nations and 26,170 from elsewhere. Gupta noted that there was an increase of 23,298 foreign tourists from SAARC countries and 2,105 from other nations in 2025 compared to 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reflects a rise of 17.57 per cent from SAARC countries and 7.44 per cent from other regions. The number of both domestic and foreign tourists is on the rise in Mustang. However, the anticipated growth in foreign tourist numbers was hindered by the Gen-Z movement&#8217;s impact on September 8 and 9, according to Gupta. Initially, it was projected that foreign tourist numbers would increase by approximately 30 per cent in 2025, but the expected rise did not materialise due to lower tourist numbers in September, October, and November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports indicate that in September 2025, there were 3,638 fewer foreign tourists, 854 fewer in October, and 70 fewer in November compared to 2024. Chief Gupta mentioned that tourist numbers increased from January to August and continued to rise until the end of December. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The predominant group of visitors to this destination is comprised of Indians. According to ACAP chief Gupta, 82 per cent of the tourists arriving here hail from SAARC nations, while 18 per cent come from other regions. Notably, over 90 per cent of the tourists from SAARC countries are Indians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Photo: Rajesh Dhungana</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Often seen near ponds, rice fields, and irrigation canals, the checkered keelback snake is one of Nepal\u2019s most attractive and valuable species in the ecosystem. The unique features of this snake, including its checkered pattern and swimming ability, make it an intriguing species to observe. In addition, its role in controlling the population of small species such as fish and frogs helps maintain the balance of the ecosystem. This characteristic makes this snake an important predator. The conservation of its natural habitat and its survival play an important role in maintaining the overall biodiversity of the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The checkered keelback snake thrives in its natural habitats, which include freshwater ponds, lakes, canals, and streams in various parts of Nepal. It uses reeds, aquatic plants, and crevices to live its adapted life. The checkered keelback snake, found almost throughout the mainland of Nepal, has successfully adapted to live among humans. In cities, they live in gardens, fields, courtyards, and any damp places where they can find shelter and food. In rural areas, checkered keelback snakes prefer rice fields because of the abundance of fish and frogs they provide. They are also common in open wells, irrigation tanks, lakes, and ponds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The checkered keelback, whose scientific name is Fowlea piscator, is also known as the Asiatic water snake. In Nepal, this snake is called the water snake, while in the local language of the Kapilvastu district, it is called the <em>Dodahawa</em> snake.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4886\" height=\"2369\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Checkered-Keelback-Snake-by-Rajesh-Dhungana-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577429\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While I was photographing this snake, I saw local children identifying this species and playing with or killing it by holding its tail or wrapping it around a stick. The locals consider this snake to be non-venomous. This snake is found in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, West Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, China, Australia, Taiwan, and Indonesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The body of the checkered keelback snake is slender and long, making it agile and swift. Its skin has a distinctive checkered pattern, with black and light yellow stripes. The average length of the checkered keelback snake is about 3 to 4 feet. It weighs 200 to 500 grams. They are relatively light, which allows them to move quickly, and they can also swim well due to their flat and broad tail. The eyes of this snake are shorter than their distance from the nostrils in adults. Its rostral scale is visible from above. The inner nasal scales are very narrow at the front and have a sub-triangular shape, with the anterior angle truncated and their length equal to that of the prefrontal scales. The frontal skate is longer than its distance from the end of the snout, and it is as long as the parietals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checkered keelback snakes are semi-aquatic and rarely venture far from water. They live a solitary life and are active both day and night. These snakes can be aggressive. They often try to raise their heads as high as possible and spread their neck skin, imitating the hood of a cobra, to scare off danger. If they cannot escape from danger, they will easily strike and bite viciously. They can also lose their tail as an escape mechanism.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4800\" height=\"1952\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Checkered-Keelback-Snake-by-Rajesh-Dhungana-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577430\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These snakes are carnivorous and usually feed on small fish and water frogs, mice, lizards, small birds, insects, and even small snakes. This makes them a valuable predator, helping to maintain the balance of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checkered keelback snakes lay eggs. The clutch size can usually be 30 to 70 or more eggs, and each egg can be 1.5 to 4.0 centimetres long. They typically have an incubation period of 37 to 60 days, during which the female stays with her eggs. Females guard their eggs until they hatch. Each hatchling measures about 11 centimetres in length. In English, we refer to a baby snake as a snakelet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Capacity Building Officer of the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), Sunil Sapkota, the checkered keelback is a snake that gives <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/snakebites-in-nepal-know-everything.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/snakebites-in-nepal-know-everything.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">venomous bites</a> with unknown dangerousness. People also call it a water snake in English and a dhodiya in Nepali. Interestingly, the species also holds cultural and religious significance in some communities. In Shardanagar, Bharatpur-19 of Chitwan, the snake was reportedly worshipped for over a month, reflecting the complex relationship between people and snakes in Nepal. According to theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the checkered keelback snake is classified as a species of \u201cleast concern\u201d due to its wide distribution and stable population. However, habitat loss due to human activities such as deforestation and urbanisation may pose a threat to the snake\u2019s survival. In addition, a lack of public awareness leads children in the Terai region, in particular, to catch and kill the snake with sticks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

For the last 13 years, National Dress Day has been observed on January 1st, which is believed to have aided in the resurgence of the national dress.

Rather than representing contradiction, this duality reveals a middle-income transition economy where technical macroeconomic competence has outpaced institutional capacity to distribute opportunity equitably. The <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/explainer-gen-z-protest-gov-brutality.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/explainer-gen-z-protest-gov-brutality.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">September 2025 political crisis</a> catalyzed institutional self-correction. As Nepal enters 2026, the nation possesses the economic foundation, democratic resilience, and generational motivation necessary for structural transformation, provided March elections establish political legitimacy sufficient to implement reform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Poverty reduction at scale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2025&#8217;s most consequential but least publicized accomplishment was Nepal&#8217;s substantial progress in poverty reduction. According to the Nepal Living Standards Survey IV (NLSS-IV) 2022-23, poverty measured at the national poverty line stands at 20.27% of the population, down from 25.16% in 2010-11 (National Statistics Office, 2024). When measured against the inflation-adjusted 2010-11 poverty threshold (NRs. 42,845 or US$298 in 2023 prices), Nepal has reduced poverty to 3.57%- demonstrating near-eradication under the previous standard. The Multidimensional Poverty Index, measuring deprivations across health, education, and living standards, declined from 30.1% in 2014 to 20.1% by 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This progress reflects three decades of sustained investment in health systems, educational infrastructure, and social protection mechanisms. Extreme poverty (US$2.15 per day) has been nearly eliminated at 0.4% of the population (World Bank, 2024). More than 13.5 million Nepalis remain living under US$6.85 per day, but this represents substantial improvement from historical baselines. Rural-urban disparities remain significant. Rural poverty stands at 24.66% compared to 18.34% in urban areas (National Statistics Office, 2024). Provincial variations are substantial, with Sudarpaschim at 34.16% and Karnali at 26.69%, while Gandaki (11.88%) and Bagmati (12.59%) have substantially lower incidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poverty progress carries particular significance for understanding the September 2025 political crisis. Rising development expectations- a direct consequence of improved literacy, health outcomes, and social visibility- created intolerance for governance failures that previous generations accepted as inevitable. The crisis was not proof of development failure; it was proof that development had proceeded sufficiently to generate legitimate expectations for institutional accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Macroeconomic stability: Foundation for growth</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beneath poverty reduction figures lies macroeconomic stability positioning Nepal for sustained expansion. GDP growth reached 4.6% in FY25, up from 3.7% in FY24 (World Bank, 2025). Inflation control proved exemplary, with headline inflation declining to 4.1% in FY25 from 5.4% in FY24, falling below the Nepal Rastra Bank&#8217;s 5% ceiling. Consumer price inflation had declined to 1.87% by mid-September 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The external sector exhibited particular resilience. Foreign exchange reserves reached record-high levels, while the current account surplus widened to 6.7% of GDP in FY25 from 3.9% in FY24, supported by remittances. Remittance inflows surged to Rs553.31 billion (US$3.85 billion) in the first quarter of FY25/26, a 35.4% year-on-year increase (Nepal Rastra Bank, 2025). Monthly remittance flows exceeded Rs200 billion (US$1.39 billion) for the first time in Nepal&#8217;s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiscal performance strengthened correspondingly, with the fiscal deficit narrowing to 2% of GDP in FY25, a nine-year low, supported by stronger revenue mobilization reaching 20% of GDP. The government formulated a record Rs1.96 trillion (US$13.63 billion) budget for FY25/26, with explicit prioritization of infrastructure development, productive sector investment, and social inclusion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democratic resilience: Institutional self-correction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The September 2025 events demonstrated Nepal&#8217;s democratic institutions&#8217; capacity for self-correction under pressure. On September 4, the government suspended 26 social media platforms, widely perceived as censorship. This mobilized approximately 200,000 young Nepalis- predominantly secondary and tertiary students- who gathered in Kathmandu and major provincial cities demanding accountability and institutional reform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their grievances centered on structural realities: youth unemployment at 20.82%, widespread corruption in governance, and absence of dignified employment opportunities within national borders. Police deployed tear gas, water cannons, and eventually live ammunition. Parliamentary buildings were stormed and damaged, with government administrative headquarters (Singha Durbar) sustaining significant structural damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Nepal responded differently.\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When protesters demanded change, Nepal&#8217;s political system made a choice that many developing countries don&#8217;t make: instead of using military force or emergency rule, it removed the government. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on September 9 (Al Jazeera, 2025). The President dissolved Parliament on September 12, and appointed an interim government to organize democratic elections for March 2026. By September 9, casualty figures ranged from 51 to 74 deaths- variation reflecting categorization differences- with over 1,000 injuries reported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who led the transition and why it mattered.\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government appointed Sushila Karki as interim Prime Minister- a retired Chief Justice and Nepal&#8217;s first female head of government. This choice was significant because Karki is a respected legal expert, not a politician. By selecting her, the system signaled that institutional credibility mattered more than partisan politics. The interim cabinet also included Gen Z activists and technical experts, showing the government was genuinely listening to those who had protested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why this response shows democratic health.\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s September crisis demonstrated the essential mechanics of democratic accountability: institutional failure triggers public mobilization, which forces governmental change through legitimate institutional channels, culminating in democratic renewal via scheduled elections. In many other countries at similar moments, military takeover, extended political chaos, or authoritarian rule occurs instead. Nepal chose the democratic path. The fact that Nepal&#8217;s institutions chose democratic transition- even during a violent crisis- shows that democratic values run deeper than the crisis itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The employment crisis: Structural vulnerability and solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s employment structure represents the nation&#8217;s central vulnerability and genuine origin of political instability. Youth unemployment- defined as labor force participants aged 15-24 seeking but unable to secure employment- reached 20.82%, more than double the overall unemployment rate of 10.71%. More critically, 84.6% of Nepal&#8217;s total employment occurs in the informal sector, meaning workers lack formal contracts, social protection, pension coverage, or dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The employment crisis manifests visibly in outmigration. In the first quarter of FY25/26 alone, 200,716 Nepalis departed with formal work permits- an 18% year-on-year increase representing approximately 2,230 daily departures. Over 3.5 million Nepalis now reside abroad for work purposes, with substantial concentrations in Malaysia (approximately 300,000) and Gulf Cooperation Council states (approximately 1.3 million). Student outmigration accelerated simultaneously, with 119,409 Nepali students pursuing education abroad in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sectoral composition of Nepal&#8217;s economy explains the employment crisis. Agriculture, which employs 11.7 million people, grows at merely 2.9% annually- insufficient to generate income commensurate with education levels or absorb expanding labor supply. Manufacturing contributes only 5% of GDP, declining from 9% two decades prior. The services sector, expanding at 6.3% annually, generates employment predominantly in low-productivity informal activities rather than skilled formal services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sectoral misalignment between population growth, human capital accumulation, and formal employment generation created the underlying structural condition that exploded into a visible political crisis in September. Young Nepalis had invested years in education based on development promises of economic opportunity, only to discover formal employment remained scarce regardless of qualification level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the employment crisis clarifies required policy solutions. Labor market failures of this magnitude typically reflect policy-induced obstacles: infrastructure inadequacy limiting manufacturing capacity, regulatory burden discouraging formal firm registration, inadequate skills alignment with labor market demand, and capital constraints preventing agricultural mechanization. Each barrier has documented evidence-based remedies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sectoral performance and economic diversification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tourism recovery proceeded more rapidly than many analysts anticipated given September&#8217;s turmoil. Nepal welcomed 815,000 international tourists in 2025, with arrivals through October reaching 943,716- approximately 98% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Recovery to 98% of pre-pandemic levels meant hundreds of thousands of livelihoods stabilized despite institutional turbulence. Critically, tourism recovery at this pace despite September&#8217;s crisis indicates that demand for Nepal&#8217;s experience is structurally rooted in geography, culture, and heritage rather than cyclically dependent on temporary conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>International trade performance demonstrated more dramatic transformation. Export values surged 88.6% in the first two months of FY25/26 compared to the equivalent prior-year period. Soybean oil exports reached 43.2% of the export basket, reflecting agricultural value-chain development; manufactured goods contributed substantially; and electricity exports achieved Rs8.64 billion (US$60.07 million)- the first meaningful revenue from Nepal&#8217;s hydropower capacity. High-value domestic production accounted for 35.68% of total exports, suggesting a growing proportion of value addition within Nepal rather than mere re-exporting activity. Domestic agricultural and industrial production grew at 6.62%, indicating genuine underlying economic activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Governance deficits and reform opportunities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s placement on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2025 for inadequate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks represented necessary international accountability. The grey-list designation identified specific technical deficiencies in financial sector oversight, banking regulation, and criminal prosecution capacity. Rather than representing shameful failure, the designation clarified the precise institutional reforms required to address systemic vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Special Court&#8217;s filing of 55 corruption cases involving high-level officials- including five former ministers and ten former secretaries- indicated institutional capacity to investigate and prosecute high-level corruption. However, weak institutional independence, inconsistent enforcement, and political interference in judicial processes created the accountability deficit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet 2025 also demonstrated that public expectations for governance accountability had risen substantially. The Gen Z mobilization reflected intolerance for governance failures that previous generations accepted as inevitable. This cultural shift in accountability expectations represents a genuine institutional advantage: future governments operating under heightened public scrutiny will face stronger incentives for transparent governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">LDC graduation: Transition with opportunity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal is scheduled to graduate from<a href=\"https://www.un.org/ldcportal/content/nepal-graduation-status\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.un.org/ldcportal/content/nepal-graduation-status\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Least Developed Country</a> (LDC) status in November 2026- a milestone carrying both real adjustment costs and genuine economic implications. Nepal will become the first country to graduate from LDC status without meeting the income criterion of US$1,306 per capita Gross National Income. Nepal&#8217;s per capita GNI reached approximately US$1,300 in 2024 assessments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LDC graduation confers tangible adjustment costs. Nepal will lose preferential market access through duty-free, quota-free arrangements. Concessional financing terms will shift toward commercial rates. The International Trade Centre estimated export losses of US$59 million (4.3% of projected 2026 exports) upon graduation, with a declining trajectory toward US$40 million by 2030 as the economy adapts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The private sector&#8217;s concerns about graduation timing reflect legitimate transition management questions. The Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry formally requested government negotiation of a three-year extension, citing weak private investment capacity, manufacturing sector underdevelopment, and concerns that graduation coinciding with election-year political transition creates double adjustment pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, LDC graduation simultaneously opens strategic possibilities. Graduation signals to international investors that Nepal has achieved sufficient institutional and human development maturity to warrant graduation from aid-dependent classification, creating opportunity to integrate Nepal into more competitive regional value chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hydropower: The transformation engine</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps Nepal&#8217;s most concrete opportunity for sustainable economic transformation lies in hydropower development. Nepal possesses approximately 43,000 megawatts of technically feasible hydropower potential- one of the world&#8217;s highest endowments- yet had only 3,421.956 megawatts installed capacity as of March 2025. This represents one of the world&#8217;s most underutilized renewable energy resources and a genuine comparative advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal targets 942 megawatts of additional capacity from major project completions during 2026-2027. The 140-megawatt Tanahu hydropower project is expected to achieve commercial operation by May 2026 (Kathmandu Post, 2024). Dudhkoski (670 MW), Lower Seti, and Budhigandaki projects follow in sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If completion accelerates, electricity production could become a major foreign exchange earner by 2027-2028. Regional demand from India is substantial and documented- India&#8217;s electricity deficit and dependence on hydropower imports create structural demand for Nepal&#8217;s supply. Price escalation mechanisms in power trade agreements can deliver appreciating revenue streams. This could eventually rival remittances as Nepal&#8217;s largest external income source while creating manufacturing opportunities around equipment supply and maintenance service provision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Structural reform imperatives for 2026-2027</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufacturing and job creation&nbsp;demand deliberate industrial policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special Economic Zones require strengthening through reliable electricity supply, simplified customs procedures, access to finance, and tax incentives for labor-intensive manufacturing. The planned Integrated Project Bank system aims to rationalize infrastructure development, preventing duplication and improving allocation efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labor market and skills&nbsp;alignment requires prioritization of TVET expansion. The QualiTY project targets 48,000 youth- with 60% from disadvantaged backgrounds and 50% women- with accreditation across 250 TVET schools nationwide. This represents deliberate effort to align skills development with documented labor market demand in construction, manufacturing, and services sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agricultural transformation&nbsp;is essential for the 11.7 million people employed in the sector. Mechanization through equipment leasing programs, improved irrigation through completion of major irrigation projects, seed quality improvements, and value-chain development represent complementary interventions with substantial productivity potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital governance&nbsp;requires accelerated implementation of digital systems across revenue administration, procurement, licensing, and public services. The Nagarik App (Citizen App) initiative aims to deliver all government services through digital platforms by 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">March 5, 2026 Elections: Democratic proving ground</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal will hold general elections on March 5, 2026, electing 275 members to the House of Representatives through a mixed first-past-the-post and proportional representation system. As of December 29, 2025, all major political parties had submitted candidate lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful elections would constitute significant democratic achievement. If elections proceed without substantial disruption and produce a government with sufficient legitimacy to implement necessary structural reforms, Nepal will demonstrate that its institutions can absorb institutional shock and reconstitute themselves through democratic means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The economic forecasts for 2026-2027 expectations are contingent on successful election outcomes. The Asian Development Bank&#8217;s earlier projection of 5.1% growth for FY2026 assumed political continuity; the World Bank&#8217;s October revision downward to 2.1% explicitly acknowledged September&#8217;s impact on investor sentiment. The World Bank&#8217;s FY2027 rebound forecast to 4.7% growth assumes successful political transition and resumed private investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Regional context and strategic positioning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s geographic position between India and China creates both vulnerability and opportunity. India remains Nepal&#8217;s largest trade partner, accounting for approximately two-thirds of bilateral trade. Hydropower cooperation offers substantial bilateral opportunities if developed transparently through negotiated power purchase agreements. Manufacturing integration into Indian supply chains represents a secondary opportunity as Nepal develops Special Economic Zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>China&#8217;s Belt and Road Initiative presence has expanded substantially within Nepal. Recent Chinese diplomatic engagement reflects strategic interest in maintaining influence in this geopolitically sensitive nation. Nepal&#8217;s optimal strategic approach involves balanced engagement with both neighbors, leveraging hydropower cooperation with India, pursuing transparent infrastructure financing from multiple sources, and maintaining the principled non-alignment framework that has historically served Nepal&#8217;s strategic interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: 2025&#8217;s inflection point, 2026&#8217;s opportunity window</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s 2025 experience defies simple categorization as either triumph or crisis. The nation achieved substantial poverty reduction- 20.27% of the population living below the national poverty line in 2022-23, down from 25.16% in 2010-11- while simultaneously experiencing governance failures producing public demand for institutional change. The political crisis represented institutional self-correction rather than democratic failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nepal enters 2026, the nation possesses a credible foundation for sustained inclusive growth. Macroeconomic stability provides a platform for growth. Democratic resilience suggests institutions can absorb political transition. Development achievements demonstrate institutional capacity for inclusive outcomes. Sectoral diversification- hydropower, agriculture, manufacturing, tourism- offers concrete opportunity pathways. Generational mobilization has raised accountability expectations, creating incentives for transparent governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The March 5 elections constitute the critical juncture. Success in holding credible elections and producing a government with mandate to implement structural reforms would enable Nepal to translate macroeconomic stability into employment generation, institutional legitimacy into reform implementation, and human capital investment into productivity growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obstacles are real: political uncertainty, global economic volatility, infrastructure implementation constraints, private investment hesitation during election periods. But the combination of technical capacity, financial resources, democratic legitimacy (if elections succeed), and generational commitment to transformation creates a genuinely credible foundation for 2026-2027 inclusive growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2026 will test whether Nepal can convert achievements into transformation- whether poverty reduction and macroeconomic stability become foundations for employment generation and opportunity creation. For a nation that has demonstrated resilience across technical competence, democratic processes, and human capital development, that represents both the defining challenge and the genuine possibility ahead.</p>\n",

He said traffic congestion continues from Dumkibas Bazaar onward, adding that long vehicle queues on the one-way highway due to ongoing road construction have made traffic management particularly difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engineer Bikash Khanal, Information Officer of the Narayanghat\u2013Butwal Road Project (Western Section), said vehicle pressure remains high in the western section as cold wave conditions persist in the construction areas. He said gravel is currently being laid in the Khursani Khola area, and cargo vehicles have been stopped at Bardaghat and Bhutaha until conditions improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hundreds of passengers have been stranded due to the traffic jam that has continued for three days. Issuing a notice, the Narayanghat\u2013Butwal Road Project (Western Section) has requested vehicles other than those providing essential services to use alternative routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project stated that vehicle operation in the Daunne section has been seriously affected due to road construction and maintenance work on one hand, and muddy conditions caused by the cold wave on the other.</p>\n",

Speaking at the 23rd anniversary of Road Board Nepal today, the minister said the government would no longer tolerate contractors who fail to complete road projects within the stipulated deadlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is not a matter of choice for the government, but a compulsion.&#8221; The minister also added that while the demand for road improvements is high, limited budget allocations have become a major obstacle to intervening on such projects on time. Secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Keshab Kumar Sharma, said that development should not be measured merely by construction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stressed the need for building usable and quality roads, adding that the timely restoration of damaged roadways is an urgent priority. Road Board Nepal Executive Director Ganesh Bahadur KC said that delays in maintaining damaged roads increase costs by three to four times. Likewise, Director General of the Department of Roads, Dr Bijay Jaishi, described road infrastructure as the backbone of development and called for guaranteeing the budget to ensure the timely restoration of damaged roadways.</p>\n",

The New Year becomes a chance to renew our mindset and way of living \u2014 an opportunity to pause, reflect, and set meaningful intentions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we often ask ourselves how to live better or what kind of life to create, real change does not always require grand gestures. Even small improvements can lead to a more beautiful and balanced life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are ten resolutions for the New Year 2026 that can truly make a difference:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Stop eating after sunset</strong><br>Prioritising health by avoiding meals after sunset is a strong step towards well-being. As the digestive system also slows down at night, late-night meals can disrupt digestion, affect sleep, and leave you feeling mentally sluggish the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both ancient Eastern philosophy and modern science recommend eating light, nutritious meals early \u2014 in sync with the sun&#8217;s cycle. While not always practical for late workers, aiming to eat before sunset as often as possible is a worthwhile goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Be in bed by 10 PM</strong><br>Our bodies are wired to align with a biological clock. As the day ends, the body seeks rest and begins storing energy for the next day. Sleeping late interferes with this natural rhythm, potentially leading to health problems.<br>No matter your schedule, resolving to be in bed by 10 PM can help maintain energy and vitality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Avoid checking your phone right after waking up</strong><br>Starting your day with a screen can flood your brain with stressful or unproductive content. Instead of beginning the day with calm and clarity, your mood might be hijacked by negativity.<br>Try to avoid your phone for at least 30 minutes after waking \u2014 a simple shift that can dramatically improve your mornings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Don\u2019t use a vehicle for short distances</strong><br>Using cars or bikes for nearby errands has become common, but it reduces physical activity. In 2082 BS, make a conscious choice to walk short distances.<br>Walking boosts circulation, burns calories, and offers a refreshing change of pace while being environmentally friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Show love and respect to animals</strong><br>We share this planet with animals, and they deserve kindness. Many species have coexisted with humans for centuries. Make a pledge not to harm or mistreat them.<br>Compassionate behaviour helps foster a more civilised world for future generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Avoid using your phone during conversations</strong><br>This small habit can greatly improve your relationships. Focusing on your phone while someone is speaking not only interrupts communication but can also feel disrespectful.<br>By being present in conversations, you strengthen bonds and create more meaningful interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Don\u2019t waste time on idle chatter over tea</strong><br>While occasional chats can ease stress and build connections, frequent, aimless gossip drains time and hampers productivity.<br>Commit to using time more constructively \u2014 for learning, creating, or self-development \u2014 while maintaining a healthy balance in socialising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Practice listening more than speaking</strong><br>Vowing to listen more and speak less fosters understanding and patience. By genuinely hearing others, you learn and grow.<br>This resolution is especially powerful in discussions or debates and can refine your personality over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. Distance yourself from unnecessary friendships</strong><br>While friends are important, not all friendships are beneficial. Letting go of negative or unproductive companions can bring peace and clarity.<br>Although distancing yourself may be emotionally difficult, gradually spending more time with positive people can enhance your overall quality of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10. Stop mocking others on social media</strong><br>Criticising or belittling others online may seem entertaining to some, but it spreads negativity.<br>Instead, share content that uplifts and inspires. Doing so supports both your own mental health and that of others. While social media is hard to avoid, choosing kindness over criticism is always a powerful move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Multi-sport events such as the Commonwealth Games are also scheduled for the same year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major events like the FIFA World Cup football tournament, and the ICC T20 World Cup cricket, along with various other international tournaments of different sports held annually, will continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year 2026 will also be significant for Nepali sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Nepal will not be playing in the FIFA World Cup, it will be participating in the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup this year. This will be Nepal\u2019s third appearance in the T20 World Cup. Similarly, Nepal will participate in various sports at the Asian Games, aiming to win medals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Nepal will play in the Cricket World Cup in 2026, in football it is scheduled to play only the SAFF Championship. The major sports tournaments in&nbsp; which Nepal will participate in 2026 are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ICC T20 World Cup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th edition of the ICC T20 World Cup will be held in India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, with a total of 20 teams, including Nepal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since associate nations will get the opportunity to play against Test nations in the T20 World Cup, the tournament will be important for smaller nations and emerging teams like Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal will be playing the T20 World Cup for the second consecutive time and the third time overall. Nepal made its World Cup debut at the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. Last year, Nepal also played in the T20 World Cup held in the United States and the West Indies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal has been placed in Group C of the World Cup, where it will face three Test nations, England, West Indies, and Bangladesh, along with Italy, which has qualified for the T20 World Cup for the first time. England and West Indies are former champions. While Nepal has previously played T20 internationals against West Indies and Bangladesh, this will be Nepal\u2019s first encounter with England and Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Women\u2019s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"466\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/women-cricket-nepal-768x466-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-575095\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very beginning of 2026, Nepal will host an important tournament, the ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be the biggest tournament ever held in the history of Nepali women\u2019s cricket and also the largest cricket event hosted by Nepal so far. Previously, Nepal had hosted the Asia regional qualifiers for the men\u2019s T20 World Cup, but this will be the first time Nepal is hosting a global qualifier for any World Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Women\u2019s T20 World Cup to be held in England and Wales in 2026 will also be determined through this Global Qualifier, where 10 nations, including Nepal, will compete. Nepal\u2019s women\u2019s team secured a place in the Global Qualifier for the first time by finishing among the top two in the Asia regional qualifiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matches of the qualifier will be played at the TU International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur and the Upper Mulpani Cricket Ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Global Qualifier, Bangladesh, Ireland, Namibia, Papua New Guinea, and the United States are in Group A, while host Nepal is placed in Group B along with the Netherlands, Scotland, Thailand, and Zimbabwe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aichi\u2013Nagoya Asian Games</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest sporting events Nepal will take part in during 2026 will be the 20th Asian Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal will participate in the 20th Aichi\u2013Nagoya Asian Games, to be held in Aichi and Nagoya, Japan, from September 19 to October 4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under \u201cMission 2026,\u201d special training programs in various sports are being conducted with the goal of winning double-digit medals, including at least one gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, due to disputes related to the Olympic Committee in Nepal, uncertainty remains over how many athletes Nepal will send and in how many sports. However, Nepal has registered 32 sports for participation in the Asian Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Winter Olympics / Winter Paralympics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics will also be held in 2026. The Winter Olympics will take place from February 6 to 22 in Milan and Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 16 winter sports will be included, with an estimated 3,000 athletes from 90 countries participating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Nepal, it has not yet been decided which athletes will compete in which events. Since qualification is required, no Nepali athletes have qualified so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the Winter Paralympics will be held in Italy from March 6 to 15, featuring six para sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Asian Beach Games</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sixth Asian Beach Games will also be held this year, from April 22 to 30 in Sanya, China, featuring competitions in 14 sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All 45 member nations of the Olympic Council of Asia are expected to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first edition of the Asian Beach Games was held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2008 and was organized every two years thereafter. Although the fifth edition was held in 2016, the Games could not be organized afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asian Beach Games scheduled for 2020 could not take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After a gap of a decade, the Games are being held again. The Nepal Olympic Committee has stated that Nepal will participate in both the Asian Beach Games and the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dakar Youth Olympics 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Youth Olympic Games will also be held this year. The Dakar Youth Olympics 2026 will take place in Senegal from October 31 to November 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nepal Olympic Committee has confirmed that Nepal will also participate in the Dakar Youth Olympics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Youth Olympic Games began in Singapore in 2010. The fourth edition is set to be held in Senegal. The second edition was held in Nanjing, China, and the third edition in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the fourth edition was originally scheduled for 2022, it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CAVA Club Volleyball in the Maldives</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In volleyball, Nepal Police Club will compete in the CAVA Women\u2019s Club Championship at the beginning of the year. The CAVA Women\u2019s Champions League will be held in Mal\u00e9, Maldives, in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, the championship was scheduled to be held in Kathmandu in December. However, due to the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/explainer-gen-z-protest-gov-brutality.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/explainer-gen-z-protest-gov-brutality.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gen Z movement</a>, international sporting events in Nepal were affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the CAVA Women\u2019s Championship and the CAVA Women\u2019s Champions League could not be held in Nepal.</p>\n",

It reflects like a societal mirror and paints unspoken emotions, memories, dreams and truths, shaping them into forms only creativity can give. To let your quiet thoughts scream and dance at the applause of the audience is both terrifying and exhilarating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet stepping onto the stage and transforming the unheard stories into a performance requires courage- a courage that grows where artists are met with understanding and respect. It takes even greater vision and effort to build such platforms that not only recognise such emotional labour but also celebrate the vulnerability that\u2019s quietly embedded within.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jhilmil-e-Saajh, curated by Thoplo Arts, has emerged as such a platform, thoughtfully designed to honour both creation and performance. Founded two years ago, Thoplo Arts is a collective of four members: Saugat Sapkota, Pushpa Devkota, Kritika Koirala and Mira Tamang, established to encourage the artists to narrate their unheard stories through poetry-based performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saugat Sapkota, one of the founding members of Thoplo Arts, emphasised that while each platform comes with its own format and guidelines that may limit creative expression, establishing Thoplo Arts allowed him the freedom to fully explore and realise his own ideas in art and poetry. Beyond that, Thoplo Arts envisioned a community where not only art but also the connection between artists and their audience could thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the focus on true connection and poetry supported by theatrical presentation and live music, the group has steadily shaped \u2018Jhilmil-e-Saajh\u2019, a distinctive cultural space. It also features \u2018Ka-bee\u2019z Roundtable\u2019 where the artists meet up and creatively share their ideas and participate in discussions collectively and reflect on themes inspired by different societal and daily life events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The journey began on November 11th, 2023, at Ujama Koffie, with the first edition of Jhilmil-e-Saajh as an open-mic poetry event. Poets shared their creations freely, building an intimate evening full of telling, listening and connections. The positive reception set the stage for subsequent editions, each exploring new themes and innovative forms of expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Jhilmil-e-Saajh 2.0, the event moved to Kausi Theatre, introducing selected poets performing under theatrical lighting accompanied by live music, while still keeping an open-mic segment for emerging voices. The third edition of Jhilmil-e-Saajh, held in collaboration with Blind Rocks, celebrated both the beauty of love and the unique beauty of disability in romantic poems, exemplifying motivational inclusivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later editions continued to explore varied themes and presentation styles. The fourth edition featured a park-like concept, and the fifth experimented with storytelling through shadow performance. The latest Jhilmil-e-Saajh, sixth edition, was inspired by wabi-sabi philosophy, embracing the beauty of impermanence and imperfections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jhilmil-e-Saajh 6.0 was organised on December 20th at Kausi Theatre, Kathaghera Productions, Teku. It featured a powerful performative poetry event accompanied by live Sarod music by Vivek Neupane and performed by ten talented artists, staged within a striking prison-like setting. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577389\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Symbolically, confined within the \u201cprison of life,\u201d the performers portrayed a space from which escape seemed impossible and even survival felt suffocating. This compelling concept emerged from the lived experiences of the curators, who view life itself as a prison where human beings remain trapped, merely existing rather than truly living. One by one, at the call of the cell in charge, each prisoner stepped out to deliver their poetry, creating moments that silenced the room while filling it with deep admiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ten poets who made Jhilmil-e-Saajh truly a jhilimili saajh are listed here:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adina Sharma</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ajnabee Khadka</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Biren Shrestha</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Krishu Lamichhane</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kritika Koirala</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kritika Sharma</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mira Tamang</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pushpa Devkota</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Raju Ubarkoti</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saugat Sapkota</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The evening drew to a poignant close as the final performance unfolded, leaving the audience visibly moved. As the last prisoner returned to the cage, the symbolism deepened, reminding everyone that the prison of life does not easily release its captives. The performers then gathered together in silence, allowing the weight of the words to linger in the air. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577386\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The event concluded not with celebration, but with reflection, as the audience rose in applause, acknowledging the courage, vulnerability, and artistic brilliance of the poets. Jhilmil-e-Saajh ended as it began with quiet intensity, leaving behind questions that echoed long after the lights dimmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overwhelming response from both the audience and the performers each time Thoplo Arts organises such events leaves a deep mark on their aim, reinforces their vision and motivates them to continue creating similar living stages. These coteries aim to nurture human connection and build a community where people arrive with confusion and depart with a sense of belongingness and inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1251.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577387\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a poet performer of Jhilmil-e-Saajh 6.0, I felt as though my poem that I wrote on paper two years ago while contemplating my grandmother\u2019s lonely years had found a lap to rest its heaviness. With a hundred eyes carefully gazing at me while I performed made me realise that this was where I was meant to be, where I truly belonged. In this warm coterie, my words were not merely heard or read; they were felt, lived and shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exchange between me and the audience felt deeply intimate, with warm daps on my shoulder, dissolving the distance between the stage and the seats. In that moment, my personal memories transformed into a collective experience. Jhilmil-e-Saajh, for me, thus became more than just a performance; it became my religion where the stories found their listeners, pain found understanding, and art found its true purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG-20251220-WA0126.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577388\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Photos: Adina Sharma</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

With this upgrade, Ncell can now deliver VoLTE service to five million active customers from the Pokhara data centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VoLTE technology offers high-definition (HD) voice services with faster call connectivity over the 4G network. Similarly, VoWiFi allows users to make and receive calls using their Ncell number over any Wi-Fi connection, enabling HD voice calls and SMS in areas with weak mobile signals, such as basements, high-rise buildings, and remote locations, as long as a stable Wi-Fi connection is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his visit, Minister Kharel also inspected the data centre, which currently functions as a Disaster Recovery centre. He was welcomed by Ncell\u2019s Chief Corporate and Regulatory Officer, Dilliram Shrestha and Corporate Communications and Sustainability Director Bishakha Laxmi Khadka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking after the inspection, Minister Kharel said, \u201cInfrastructure like Ncell\u2019s data centre is contributing to the government\u2019s goal of building a Digital Nepal. It stands as a key pillar supporting Nepal\u2019s digitalisation drive.\u201d He also praised the management and operations of the centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shrestha noted that the data centre, operational since 2012, has played a vital role in Nepal\u2019s telecommunications and ICT sector. \u201cWith the enhancement of VoLTE capacity, we will be extending modern VoLTE services to more customers backed by increased capacity,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the visit, Ncell\u2019s technical team briefed Minister Kharel on the data centre\u2019s capacity, technological features, and overall significance in Nepal\u2019s ICT landscape.</p>\n",

In the Gurung language, \u2018Lho\u2019 means year and \u2018Sar\u2019 denotes change. Members of the Gurung community mark the festival by organising feasts and cultural programmes. The festival is marked on the 15th day of the Nepali month of Poush, with the first rays of sunlight reaching the Gurung settlements in Lamjung, Gorkha, Tanahun, Syangja, Manang, Kaski, and Parbat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The festival is marked by the Tamang and Sherpa communities later in the Nepali months of Magh and Falgun, respectively. The government has announced a public holiday on the occasion of Tamu Lhosar today. Members of the Gurung community have been observing a special programme at Tundikhel, Kathmandu, on the occasion of Tamu Lhosar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gurungs divide their year into 12 cycles and each cycle is represented by 12 different animals \u2014 Garuda (eagle), serpent, horse, sheep, monkey, bird, dog, deer, mouse, cow, tiger and cat \u2014  which they call \u201cLho.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During each Lhosar, they bid farewell to the existing &#8216;Lho&#8217; and welcome a new one. This year, the Gurung community is going to celebrate Lhosar by bidding farewell to the Snake cycle and welcoming the Horse cycle on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Earlier, the Bibeksheel Sajha Party had already merged into the RSP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some leaders of the<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-Nepalese-Gen-Z-Protests\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-Nepalese-Gen-Z-Protests\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Gen Z movement</a> had also already entered the RSP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The political, moral, and material support of those involved in the Gen Z movement appeared to be concentrated in these three groups. Therefore, Gen Z activists had also been mounting pressure on these three forces to unite for elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concluding that it would not be possible to break the dominance of the old parties by contesting elections separately, these three forces came together. However, after the Gen Z movement, other political parties have also emerged in the name of alternative forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unification among these three forces also involved discussions on the distribution of positions within the party structure. Rabi Lamichhane will remain the party chairperson. Balen Shah will be the prime ministerial candidate. Kulman Ghising will hold the position of senior vice-chairperson, the first rank after the chairperson. There is a gentleman\u2019s agreement that 18 names in the proportional representation list will come from the Ujyalo Nepal Party and 40 from Balen Shah\u2019s side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their main objective in moving forward by distributing positions to balance internal power is to stand against misgovernance and to establish a merit-based system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeated discussions were held among the three forces to reach this agreement. In the first phase, consensus was reached between the RSP and Balen Shah. In the second phase on Monday, an agreement was reached with Kulman Ghising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, although there had been an agreement between Kathmandu Mayor Balen and RSP chair Lamichhane, a consensus could not be reached with Kulman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After forming his party, Ghising, who had been engaged in discussions with various alternative forces, met Gen Z leaders and other figures. He even publicly shared a photo with Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah, writing, \u201cWe are together in the responsibility of building the nation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the very day Ghising posted that message, the RSP and Bibeksheel Sajha unified. Even then, while signaling that he would move forward almost together with Balen, Ghising continued parallel discussions with the RSP. He even formed a negotiation committee within his party to continue talks on unity and cooperation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Ghising moved forward advocating unity with alternative forces, there were also commentaries suggesting that he made the photo with Balen public to increase his bargaining power after the RSP\u2013Bibeksheel merger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that too, Ghising remained in continuous dialogue and talked multiple times with Balen and Lamichhane. This continued even after the Lamichhane\u2013Balen agreement. Discussions among these leaders continued until Sunday night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, those discussions ended without a conclusion. After that, both parties began preparing their proportional representation lists independently. The Ujyalo Nepal Party even submitted its proportional list to the Election Commission. The RSP also held a central committee meeting to prepare its proportional list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as the Ujyalo Nepal Party was submitting its list to the Election Commission, Ghising again entered into dialogue with the RSP. After discussions with party leaders at Antara Hotel in Boudha, Ghising set out to meet Rabi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some central committee members of the Ujyalo Nepal Party were present at Antara Hotel, where an internal meeting was underway. Work was ongoing to prepare the party\u2019s proportional candidate list.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"609\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rsp-unp.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577370\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a member present at the meeting, while the Ujyalo Nepal Party\u2019s meeting was going on at Antara, RSP chair Lamichhane kept calling repeatedly. But Ghising did not answer. He was reportedly saying to those close to him, \u201cThey just keep talking, but they never actually agree.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKulman did not answer Rabi\u2019s calls. We were all almost disappointed, thinking they only talk and never agree. But suddenly Sudhan Gurung and others came and took him away,\u201d a leader close to Ghising told <a href=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"english.onlinekhabar.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Onlinekhabar</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Gen Z sources as well, Gen Z Council leader Sudhan Gurung took Kulman in a car. For the tripartite talks with Balen, Gen Z leaders Sudhan Gurung, James Karki, and Ojaswi Thapa transported Ghising to the negotiation venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just some time before that, Sudhan Gurung had gone to the RSP office itself and pressured them to also bring Kulman along before the central committee meeting began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the Gen Z leaders who took Ghising to the negotiation venue, Ojaswi Thapa, told Onlinekhabar, \u201cThey were in Boudha. We went there and requested him. Then we brought him to the negotiation venue in the car. We exerted as much pressure as possible on all sides to make them unite.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Gen Z leader, James Karki, said, \u201cWe met all three leaders today and told them, \u201cYou must unite no matter what. Otherwise, you yourselves are trying to divide Gen Z. There is no alternative to unity right now. At least do it for us.\u201d After that, the leaders who had already made up their minds to go their separate ways became ready to sit for talks again.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier too, after the unification between Lamichhane and Balen, there had been repeated efforts to unify with Kulman Ghising. Meanwhile, Ujyalo Nepal had also been holding parallel talks on unity with parties like the Pragatisheel Loktantrik Party. Even after Balen united with the RSP, tripartite dialogues among Lamichhane, Balen, and Ghising took place in phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, consensus could not be reached on the distribution of positions. According to a central member of the Ujyalo Nepal Party, even though they presented themselves very generously for unity with the RSP, the unification failed because RSP chair Lamichhane devalued one force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming that there had been a form of \u201cpolitical humiliation\u201d from the RSP, the Ujyalo Nepal Party went ahead and prepared its own proportional list and registered it with the Election Commission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRabi showed a cunning and condescending attitude. Initially, he proposed uniting with a 30 percent share, but later said, \u2018If you want, come with 15 percent,\u2019\u201d the central member says, citing this as the reason consensus was not reached earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the effort by these three sides to unite alternative forces did not emerge suddenly. Even before forming the Ujyalo Nepal Party, Ghising had held discussions with RSP vice-chair Swarnim Wagle. At that time, talks failed because Ghising insisted on becoming the party chairperson. Back then, the RSP was ready to move Ghising forward as vice-chair and even as a future prime minister. But because Ghising stuck to his demand for the chairmanship, agreement could not be reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Ghising released photos with Balen to create a favorable environment for himself. He made every possible effort to position himself at the center of alternative forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, after Lamichhane was released from Nakhu prison, dialogue among alternative forces suddenly accelerated. Lamichhane, Balen, and Kulman held separate meetings in various phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the final stage, on Sunday at dawn, an agreement was reached between Balen and Lamichhane. Ghising was left out of that unity because he maintained his demand for an executive role. Ghising\u2019s supporters argued, \u201cOne gets the chairmanship, another gets the prime ministership, what do we get?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ujyalo Nepal Party even rejected a proposal that suggested Lamichhane as chairperson, Ghising as senior leader, and Balen as prime minister. Since the party name, election symbol, chairperson, and prime ministerial candidate would all come from the RSP, Ujyalo Nepal Party became dissatisfied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ujyalo Nepal maintained that it would not dissolve its own existence to merge into the RSP. Instead, Ghising commented that even Balen, who had already united with Lamichhane, would end up being betrayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a central member of the party, during a meeting held from 1 pm to 5 pm on Saturday at a hotel in Boudha, Ghising said, \u201cIt has to be win\u2013win for everyone. Unity does not mean that someone\u2019s existence is completely erased. There should not be an environment where others are treated as nothing. Once everyone is accepted as a force, they must be treated as such.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ujyalo Nepal Party also concluded that the RSP had devalued them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cThey thought that since the chairperson and future prime minister would be from their side, we would come running anyway. This is a devaluation of our strength,\u201d a Ujyalo Nepal central member told Onlinekhabar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Kulman refused to abandon his stance, some central members of the Ujyalo Nepal Party appeared disappointed. On the very night news broke that Ghising had walked out of the negotiation venue after the Lamichhane\u2013Balen unity, a central member told Onlinekhabar, \u201cWho knows who advised him. Leaving Lamichhane and Balen and walking alone at this time, where can one really reach?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, however, Ghising joined the RSP at the last moment. Having earlier rejected an offer of the prime minister from the RSP, he now accepted unity by agreeing to Balen as the prime ministerial candidate from the same party. On the very issues and points that had caused Ghising&#8217;s dissatisfaction, he was compelled to unite with the RSP. Finally, with a seven-point agreement, he will now contest the election scheduled for March 5 1 from the RSP itself.</p>\n",

According to the agreement, Rabi Lamichhane will lead the Rastriya Swatantra Party, while Balen will be put forward as the future prime minister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After RSP Chair Lamichhane was released from custody on December 18, he intensified his political engagements. Immediately after being released from Nakhu Prison, he held various political meetings and party activities. He then met Balen several times, and on December 25, Lamichhane and Balen held one-on-one talks as part of discussions on building an alternative political force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the two sides have decided to unite, the news has triggered political reverberations across Nepal. The RSP-Balen unity has so far received mixed reviews. Mostly, individuals associated with other parties are criticising their coalition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this merger, traditional parties have started feeling challenged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the two sides signed the agreement, CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel expressed concern that preparations are underway for a second phase of a conspiracy aimed at pushing Nepal into a geopolitical conflict. Without mentioning RSP and Balen, Pokhrel <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1DGh2RB1ee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">writes </a>on Facebook, \u201cThe events of September 8 and 9 were the first phase of a conspiracy to push Nepal into instability like Ukraine by turning the country into a pawn in a geopolitical conflict. Preparations for the second phase of the same conspiracy have now begun.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pokhrel commented that the peaceful protest carried out by youths on September 8 was deliberately turned violent, resulting in the killing of several youths. He further wrote that, under the pretext of the September 8 incident, attacks were launched on September 9 against the fundamental pillars of the state and democracy, to weaken the country\u2019s sovereignty and capacity. \u201cThe planners and operators behind these destructive activities are gradually being exposed,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As new political forces move toward unity, UML General Secretary Pokhrel also stressed the need for unity among traditional political forces. \u201cIn such a serious situation, patriotic forces committed to the constitution and democracy must remain alert and united. Everyone must play a responsible and active role to prevent Nepal from becoming a pawn in a geopolitical conflict,\u201d Pokhrel wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reports emerged of alternative forces meeting to discuss political alignment, leaders of major parties also began holding talks on possible future alliances and calls for unity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A leader close to Oli also acknowledged that the environment for cooperation among the major political forces is gradually becoming more conducive. \u201cWe have already been cooperating with the Congress, and now cooperation with Prachanda\u2019s group is also possible to safeguard the constitution,\u201d he said. According to leaders, Deuba and Oli are even considering forming an electoral alliance. However, implementing Deuba\u2019s plan does not appear easy within the Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Nepali Congress leader Chandra Bhandari has also called for unity. \u201cThe union of Rabi and Balen sends this message: now, others must also be able to take and give responsibility, build trust, and move forward together,\u201d Bhandari <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AJCo9ytzF/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">writes </a>on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call for unity by leaders of traditional political parties suggests that they are aware that if they do not unite, the new forces could gain an advantage and potentially outperform them in elections or political influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the RSP and Balen hold significant potential to alter the course of the election. In the parliamentary elections, the RSP won 20 seats, becoming the fourth-largest party. Similarly, during the Local Elections 2022, Balen secured 61,767 votes. These results indicate that both sides command substantial voter support, enough to influence and challenge leaders of traditional parties in the election scheduled for March 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thewire.in/south-asia/new-political-forces-seek-common-front-against-nepals-mainstream-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reportedly</a>, although not stated openly, the international community and various organisations appear to be encouraging new political forces at the expense of traditional parties. The current government, led by Sushila Karki, is also advancing the narrative that post-election leadership should be new and youthful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the seven-point agreement between RSP Chairperson Rabi Lamichhane and Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balen Shah, interim election government spokesperson and Minister for Communication Jagdish Kharel said it marked \u201ca new day, a new beginning.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA new day, a new beginning. The dream of a beautiful and prosperous Nepal! The destination is taking shape,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1C86mExxAL/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">writes </a>on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Political commentators say that the unity of the RSP and Balen will have a significant impact in the upcoming elections, and that traditional parties have already begun feeling threatened. They also note that the traditional parties\u2019 call for unity reflects their awareness of this challenge and their desire to protect their political power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no doubt that the coalition between RSP and Balen will have a notable influence,\u201d says political analyst Saugat Gautam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately, as preferences toward alternative forces increase, Gautam adds, \u201cThose individuals seeking to vote for alternative forces will most probably vote for the RSP.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, he notes that the call for unity by the leaders of traditional parties during elections is something they have always done, but it always fails afterwards. Regarding the alternative forces, Gautam says, \u201cThey can be given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p>\n",

As the system requires balancing the proportion of women and men as well as representation from various groups and clusters, candidate selection under the proportional system is considered more complex than under the direct election system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To facilitate this process, the Election Commission organised a workshop for representatives of political parties in Kathmandu last week. Although two days are generally allocated for submissions, the final day often sees a large crowd of party representatives at the Election Commission. In previous elections, commission staff worked overnight to verify and register proportional lists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before finalising candidates, parties must have the Election Commission verify that the individual is listed on the voter roll. For this purpose, parties submit a list of potential candidates to the commission. Commission staff then check whether the individuals are registered voters and informs the parties in writing. Only after this verification can parties formally register their closed lists with the commission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Election Commission Assistant Spokesperson Kul Bahadur GC, the commission has set up more than a dozen desks to facilitate the process. \u201cWe have already started verifying the details submitted by parties and sending back the confirmations,\u201d Assistant Spokesperson GC told Onlinekhabar. \u201cSome parties have completed the verification, while others are in the process.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Representation by cluster</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the House of Representatives Proportional Election Directive, 2082, approved by the Election Commission, there will be seven clusters in the proportional list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When selecting candidates from Indigenous Nationalities, Khas Arya, Tharu, Dalit, Madheshi, Muslim, and backward regions, at least 50 per cent must be women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the latest directive, 28.72 per cent of candidates must be selected from Indigenous Nationalities, 30.28 per cent from Khas Arya, 6.52 per cent from Tharu, and 13.44 per cent from Dalit communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the Election Commission has mandated that 16.15 per cent of candidates must be from the Madheshi community, 4.89 per cent from the Muslim community, and at least 4.02 per cent from backward regions. Political parties may submit closed lists containing a minimum of 11 and a maximum of 110 candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parties must submit candidate lists that have been presented to and approved by their central committees, along with certified copies of the central committee\u2019s decision. If two or more parties merge and submit a single list, the directive requires submission of separate or joint central committee decisions from each party, clearly specifying which candidate belongs to which party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each candidate included in the closed list must also submit photocopies of their citizenship certificate and voter ID card, along with a signed consent letter agreeing to contest the election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Election Commission has also requested political parties to email a soft copy of the proportional candidate list along with the hard copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How are seats allocated?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After voting on 21 Falgun, votes from both the direct and proportional systems will be counted. Based on the total votes received by each party, a weighting system will be applied, and the names of elected lawmakers will be finalised according to cluster-wise allocation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parties that fail to cross the threshold will be excluded from proportional representation. In the previous election, the CPN (Unified Socialist), despite winning 10 seats through direct elections, failed to cross the threshold in the proportional system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several aspects of finalising proportional lawmakers depend on the results of the direct elections. For instance, if an insufficient number of women are elected through the direct system, the selection of women representatives from the proportional list becomes mandatory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if a sufficient number of women are elected directly, male candidates listed under the proportional system may also be selected. The Election Commission begins the process of allocating proportional seats only after the direct election results are finalised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Yet, at certain moments, it becomes so dense that it speaks louder than sound itself. This reflection explores that paradox\u2014the quiet yet restless dialogue between the human mind and the soul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d<br>\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\u201cI am nobody.\u201d<br>\u201cNobody?\u201d<br>\u201cYes. That is my name.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What begins as a simple exchange slowly collapses into ambiguity. Names lose their certainty, logic turns circular, and meaning dissolves into wordplay. The interrogation ends without resolution. As is often the case, conversations about life rarely reach clear answers. They simply trail off, leaving behind questions heavier than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This unfinished dialogue resembles the nature of overthinking, an internal monologue that loops endlessly. Thinking, after all, defines our humanity. Yet, when reflection crosses a certain threshold, it becomes a source of anxiety, even despair. If thinking too much is harmful, then what does it mean not to think at all? Between these extremes lies a fragile balance. We must think enough to navigate life\u2019s challenges, yet not so much that thought itself becomes a burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tension gives rise to the central concern of this essay: when silence grows loud. Silence is not always passive. At moments of decision, it presses upon us, demanding clarity. It is in such stillness that unspoken questions surface, questions without immediate answers. Silence, then, is not the absence of sound but a different form of language, one that resonates beyond words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This realisation has become increasingly vivid in my experience as a teacher. Today\u2019s classrooms are filled with a new kind of silence, not the attentive quiet of curiosity, but a heavy stillness shaped by distraction. Where students\u2019 eyes once reflected inquiry, they now glow with screens. Thumbs scroll in synchronised rhythm, and attention is fractured across digital spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My students are not disengaged in the traditional sense. They are deeply involved in conversations happening elsewhere within social media feeds, notifications, and AI-generated responses that arrive before questions fully form. The silence I encounter is crowded, saturated with invisible noise. In this environment, the role of the teacher has shifted. I am no longer only a source of knowledge but a competitor for attention, an increasingly scarce resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity itself has changed. It is no longer rooted solely in lived experience or inner reflection but fragmented across digital profiles, curated images, and performative expressions. The self has become something to display rather than to discover. As a result, the inner conversation between mind and soul\u2014once private and formative\u2014has been externalised and diluted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This persistent search for validation may conceal a deeper, unacknowledged anxiety. In an age where machines can replicate answers instantly, human effort often feels devalued. Students are not lacking intelligence; rather, they are navigating a system where struggle seems unnecessary and patience unrewarded. Ironically, in creating tools to advance ourselves, we have begun to mistrust the value of our own process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The silence in the classroom, therefore, is not meaningless. It is a loud, unspoken conversation between minds overwhelmed by digital stimulus and souls longing for authenticity and purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is not to outcompete technology, but to help students quiet the external noise long enough to hear their own internal voice. Education must reassert the dignity of effort, the necessity of struggle, and the irreplaceable value of human thought. The question \u201cWho am I?\u201d has quietly transformed into \u201cWhat is my value in a world that can replicate me?\u201d Until this question is addressed, silence will continue to echo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silence is often feared, mistaken for disengagement or absence. Yet it can be an active, even defiant space; a site of reflection, resistance, and possibility. It is not an enemy but an invitation to listen. When teachers give form to unspoken questions, they allow students\u2019 inner worlds to emerge beyond screens and algorithms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When silence grows loud, it does not signal an ending but a beginning. It asks us to rethink the teacher\u2013student relationship and to rebuild classrooms as spaces for sustained attention and deeper thought. When we learn to listen, silence transforms from weight into potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, silence is an invisible bridge connecting two distant realms within the restless mind and the enduring soul. It is where thinking pauses and witnessing begins. Silence is not empty. It is the raw, unedited voice of the soul, waiting to be heard.</p>\n",

During a public awareness event held today by the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control in Janakpur, focusing on &#8216;Enhancing Drinking Water to Mitigate Non-Communicable Diseases,&#8217; it was reiterated that approximately 71 per cent of patients are suffering from these conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Bipin Kumar Jha, Head of the Health Division of the Ministry, presented details indicating a daily increase in the number of patients with non-communicable diseases. He pointed out that the rise in non-communicable diseases is outpacing that of communicable diseases. The primary non-communicable diseases identified include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions, according to Dr Jha. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stressed that the leading contributors to non-communicable diseases are the intake of contaminated and unfit food items, polluted air and water, poor dietary habits, and a sedentary lifestyle. Dr Jha urged that improvements in lifestyle and dietary practices are essential for prevention. He also noted that this issue is becoming more prevalent in Madhes Province. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the event, Umesh Yadav, Head of the Public Health Office in Dhanusha, highlighted the necessity for collaboration between government and non-government organisations to address health challenges, while expressing concerns that budget reductions have hindered his office&#8217;s ability to deliver quality services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief of Ayurveda Hospital in Dhanusha, Dr Rudra Narayan Thakur, remarked that incorporating Ayurvedic treatments alongside yoga and meditation can be beneficial for managing and treating chronic diseases.

He usually plays songs in the background while working. But one particular song caught his attention. He liked the voice. He then checked the description and title. It felt like a new music band. When he visited the channel, he finally realised that the song had been created with the help of AI. The channel uploads only AI-generated songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a personal experience. But AI-generated songs with a similar ability to mislead listeners have now begun to flood social media. Whether it is \u201cAditya Shrestha\u2019s Pahilo Haaso, Pahilo Bol, Sab Yaad Chha\u2026\u201d or the viral snippet of \u201cPiyara Piyari,\u201d there are many such examples. Many people have even created YouTube channels dedicated to regularly uploading AI-generated songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind all this lies the growing capability of AI tools. Today, AI can produce creative works such as text, videos, photos, and music. These tools are easy to use and widely accessible. As a result, AI-generated content is appearing everywhere, experts say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, alongside its positive aspects, there is also a worrying side. According to an article in The New York Times, the use of AI poses a risk to many artists and businesses that own creative works. AI can closely replicate human-made creations, weakening the market. Moreover, AI can use artists\u2019 works as training data without their consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, no public cases have emerged in Nepal involving the theft of creators\u2019 works for AI training, legal disputes with AI companies, or organised opposition by artists against AI tools. Nevertheless, experts say AI has already had a noticeable impact on music creation and audience behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Suno are trained on large datasets and generate outputs based on that training. Without data, AI tools cannot function, and a lack of data results in poor outputs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the same New York Times article, three major debates are currently taking place worldwide: what creators should receive in return, whether \u201cfair use\u201d applies, and who owns AI-generated content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Western artists are demanding that their consent be taken and fair compensation provided if their work is used to train AI. Copyright protection currently applies only to human-created works. The answers to the remaining questions, however, remain unclear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this context, it is necessary to examine Nepal\u2019s situation. Are Nepali artists aware of this trend? What kinds of risks does AI pose to them? What do Nepali artists think about AI? What impacts and opportunities is AI creating for Nepali artists?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI-generated music continues to blur the line between human creativity and machine production, Nepal finds itself at an early but critical crossroads. While the technology offers new possibilities for experimentation, accessibility, and innovation, it also raises serious questions about artistic ownership, consent, and fair compensation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With limited awareness, weak legal safeguards, and little public debate so far, Nepali artists risk being unprepared for the long-term consequences of this rapidly evolving trend. Moving forward, informed discussion, policy clarity, and collective engagement from artists, platforms, and regulators will be essential to ensure that AI becomes a tool that supports creativity rather than undermines it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers&#8217; Association, the price of hallmark gold has reached Rs 269,000 per tola today from Rs 267,500 last Thursday. Similarly, silver is being traded at Rs 4,585 per tola today against Rs 4,400 per tola on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prices of both metals today hit a record high. Last Wednesday, the precious yellow metal was sold at Rs 268,100 per tola while silver of similar quantity was traded at Rs 4,420. Analysts say the prices of gold and silver are rising because the US dollar is getting stronger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the international market today, one ounce of gold is being traded at USD 4,500 while the price of the same quantity of silver is USD 75, according to the international news agencies. A tola is equivalent to 11.66 grammes, while an ounce weighs 31.1035 grammes.</p>\n",

A major challenge has been added to public health across the province after rabies began to spread among animals and humans from fox and stray dog bites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Naresh Prasad Joshi, senior veterinary doctor at the Animal Disease Research Laboratory in Dhangadhi, at least 18 animals have died from rabies in the past 20 days. &#8220;In a span of three years, rabies infection has been confirmed in 371 animals. This is only the number of cases reported to the laboratory. Meanwhile, it is reported that at least five people have died due to rabies infection, and since much of it might not be reported, the number of deaths could be much higher,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior veterinarian Joshi stated that a 70-year-old woman from Surma Rural Municipality\u20132 in Bajhang died this week due to rabies. According to him, earlier this year, in the month of Ashar, a child in Baitadi also died due to rabies. The highest number of rabies cases is reported in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts. Out of 170 samples collected in the fiscal year 2081/82, rabies was confirmed in 136. In that fiscal year, the highest number of infections was found in Kailali. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of 98 samples collected, 78 tested positive, followed by 43 out of 53 in Kanchanpur, five out of seven in Achham, three in Bajhang, and six out of eight in Doti. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A case of rabies was confirmed just two days ago in an animal that was wandering around biting other animals in Godawari Municipality-6, Kailali. Senior veterinarian Joshi shared that the sample collected by the laboratory&#8217;s Rapid Response Team (RRT) tested positive. Previously, rabies was confirmed in a dog in Shuklaphanta Municipality-1 of Kanchanpur, and now the fear of rabid dogs is also increasing at Ward No. 12 of the same municipality, said Ram Prasad Bhatta, head of the Municipality&#8217;s Livestock Development Branch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him, recently, foxes and jackals have suddenly started entering human settlements, and the main reason for this is the destruction of their natural habitat, which is sugarcane plantations. &#8220;After the sugarcane harvesting season begins, the places where foxes and jackals hide and their feeding areas are destroyed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the lack of shelter, jackals enter settlements in search of food, bite domestic dogs and livestock, and through this, the spread of rabies has accelerated,&#8221; Bhatta said. Veterinarian Bhojraj Pandeya said that although rabies is a fatal disease, life can be saved through timely treatment and precaution. According to him, wounds from any animal&#8217;s bite should be washed thoroughly with soap and clean water for 10\u201315 minutes, and even if the wound is minor, one should not delay and immediately go to a health facility for rabies vaccination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Wildlife experts fear the incident, recorded in the Sundarbans region of West Bengal, may indicate a shortage of food in the area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fishing cat, also known locally as the \u201cfish tiger,\u201d is considered the largest predatory mammal in wetland ecosystems. During an early morning visit to the Sundarbans last July, environmentalist Saumadeep Santar captured rare footage of a fishing cat hunting a monitor lizard\u2014an event described as highly unusual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to Mongabay India, Santar said they witnessed the fishing cat preying on the monitor lizard from their boat. \u201cI am from the Bagnan area of West Bengal, where fishing cats are relatively common. As a naturalist, I have studied their ecology and behavior, but I had never seen them hunt a monitor lizard before,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wildlife photographer Sudipta Chakraborty also photographed the same incident from a different angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wildlife expert Tiyasa Adhya, known for her work on fishing cats, described the event as a significant finding. \u201cThe fishing cat is considered the top predator in wetland ecosystems. This shows that even a powerful reptile like the monitor lizard, which is similar in size and has a strong tail, can fall prey to it,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhya noted that this may be the first documented record of a fishing cat preying on a monitor lizard. While previous studies mention fish, small rodents, reptiles, and birds in the fishing cat\u2019s diet, a monitor lizard would be considered unusually large prey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecologist Samrat Chakraborty of West Bengal also called the incident \u201cextremely unusual,\u201d noting that existing literature does not list monitor lizards as part of the fishing cat\u2019s diet. He suggested that limited food availability in the Sundarbans, combined with competition from other species, may have forced the animal into opportunistic hunting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The muddy terrain of the Sundarbans makes it difficult to quickly drag prey to safety, and an adult monitor lizard is a powerful reptile. According to experts, the fishing cat\u2019s success in such a struggle highlights its skill as a predator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographer Sudipta Chakraborty, who has been documenting wildlife for over 15 years, said the incident was an unexpected bonus during a trip aimed at photographing a tigress and her cubs. \u201cFishing cats usually rely on fish, their primary food. But this individual may not have hunted successfully for days, forcing it to prey on a monitor lizard. This is not normal behavior,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Santar agreed, adding that the timing was also unusual. \u201cThe incident occurred around 8:30 in the morning. Fishing cats, like most felines, usually hunt at night and are rarely seen in the morning unless they are extremely hungry. Moreover, the monitor lizard has very tough skin, making it difficult for a fishing cat to access the flesh,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2014 With support from Mongabay Online</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

They said that an announcement of either party unity or cooperation will be made immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Close aides say that in the unified party, Balen will be ranked just below Lamichhane in seniority. Lamichhane is also said to have reaffirmed his earlier commitment to make Balen prime minister in the first phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources claim that a basic agreement will be reached on this very point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, after failing to see progress in talks with Rabi, Balen had intensified meetings at his associate Kumar Ben\u2019s residence in Jawagal, seeking support for the Desh Bikash Party, which he is close to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balen had reportedly been displeased after Lamichhane presented issues discussed during the Kamalpokhari meeting on the night of December 22 in a different manner publicly. When Balen began consulting others, saying he would move forward under the banner of the Desh Bikash Party, Lamichhane was alarmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meeting between Lamichhane and Balen that lasted until <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rabi-balen-meeting.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/rabi-balen-meeting.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Thursday </a>afternoon, discussions focused on a possible unity process, including the party name, election symbol, and candidate ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lamichhane proposed that since there are already many aspirants within RSP, a proportional candidate list should be prepared in a 70\u201330 ratio, with room to adjust the numbers after further discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balen, however, is understood to have shown little interest in the exact proportional numbers. Kumar Ben, Asim Shah, and others are expected to work out the figures, which Balen would then endorse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After emerging from the Jawagal meeting with Balen on Thursday, Lamichhane was asked by journalists whether it would be \u201cthe stick or the bell.\u201d He replied, \u201cTime will tell.\u201d However, since the RSP\u2019s election symbol, the bell, is already widely popular, it was clarified that Balen would not have difficulty moving forward under that symbol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As talks between Lamichhane and Balen appeared to be heading toward tension, colleagues pressured both leaders to reach an agreement without delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although another round of talks was scheduled for Thursday evening, it could not take place, as Balen held a separate meeting with Kulman Ghising. With no direct dialogue yet established between Lamichhane and Ghising, Balen has taken responsibility for bringing Ghising and other influential figures together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RSP leader Asim Shah, who has long maintained close ties with Balen, said discussions are heading toward a positive conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to say at this moment what issues are close to agreement. Many things are still under discussion, and we are working to bring them to a common ground,\u201d Shah said, Onlinekhabar. \u201cBut unity among new political forces is also the sentiment of Gen Z. Respecting this sentiment, we are moving forward. You will hear a positive message soon.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Now let\u2019s collaborate. All Gen Z members should unite and come forward,\u201d Bhandari said, quoting Mayor Shah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mayor Shah has been continuously engaging in political dialogues.

According to sources, he brought a non-paper printout to the meeting with Balen, detailing matters such as the percentage of candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lamichhane suggested that since there are already enough aspirants within RSP, a proportional candidate list should be prepared in a 70\u201330 ratio. He also proposed that the ratio could be adjusted slightly after consulting with his party colleagues.</p>\n",

Sleeping on straw with only a thin sheet, Sada finds it difficult to protect himself from the cold. As he can not sleep due to the cold, he lights a fire pit at night to keep warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are poor people. It\u2019s hard enough to get a full meal; where would we get bedding?\u201d he laments on Tuesday afternoon while sitting in his courtyard sorting rice. \u201cI spread straw underneath and covered myself with a thin sheet. It doesn\u2019t stop the cold. When it gets unbearable, I can\u2019t sleep, I warm myself by the fire pit, try to heat my body, and then attempt to sleep again.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sada\u2019s wife, Sanechari Devi, also suffers from the cold due to the lack of proper bedding. Their 15-year-old house, built on public land with a straw roof, has become dilapidated and is on the verge of collapsing. The couple somehow manages their livelihood in the same house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They cannot even afford to buy a warm blanket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1230\" height=\"568\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jado-madhesh-Bauwelal-sada.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577229\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Musahar families in the same settlement have received houses built by the Madhesh provincial government under the Janata Awas (People\u2019s Housing) program. But for the Sada couple, straw and the fire pit remain their only means of escaping the cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sada\u2019s youngest son, Ramsharan, also spends the night in another straw-roofed house, relying on straw and a single blanket. Complaining that local and provincial governments have never cared about them, Sada said they are forced to endure freezing nights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearby, 65-year-old Kesodevi Sada was warming herself by the fire pit around noon. The fire was almost extinguished. Wrapped in a sheet and sitting close to the embers, Kesodevi and her family of seven are surviving on straw and a single blanket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe cold is severe. Seven of us sleep, relying on straw and a single blanket. When it\u2019s extremely cold, we even cover ourselves with straw; otherwise, we warm ourselves by the fire pit to overcome the cold,\u201d she says to <a href=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"english.onlinekhabar.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Onlinekhabar</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The condition of neighbour Raj Kishor Sada is no different. His roof is covered with torn plastic. Surrounded on three sides by ripped cloth, he sleeps on straw, covered with a thin blanket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is where my father sleeps. My nephew and sister-in-law sleep inside the house. In another place, my mother and I sleep. There is no other option,\u201d says his daughter, Bhuli Sada.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1230\" height=\"568\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Jado-chiso-madhesh-child-women.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577230\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During winter, the days and nights of 65-year-old resident Dukhni Sada are equally harsh. A single blanket given by relatives has become the family\u2019s only protection from the cold. They somehow manage to sleep, but apart from the clothes they wear and a thin sheet, they have nothing warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf relatives hadn\u2019t given us this blanket, it would have been so difficult. Straw and this blanket are our only support to get through the cold,\u201d says Dukhni. \u201cThis thin sheet is all we have for bedding. It doesn\u2019t keep out the cold. When it gets too cold, I warm myself by the fire pit.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only Bouelal, Kesodevi, and Dukhni Sada, but the entire settlement faces a shortage of bedding and warm clothing during winter. As a result, everyone, from the elderly to children, has begun to suffer from the cold. Some children do not even have slippers on their feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These settlements are just examples. For the past three days, extreme cold has intensified across Madhesh. Cold waves sweep through the region in the mornings. Almost every local unit in Madhesh has similar Dalit and impoverished settlements. As the cold intensifies, daily life has become increasingly difficult due to the lack of blankets, bedding, and warm clothing. However, neither local nor provincial governments appear to have made adequate preparations for these communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the rise in cold waves in the Terai-Madhesh region, several local governments have announced winter holidays for schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hanspur Municipality Mayor Pradip Yadav, however, claimed that there is no shortage of bedding in Dalit settlements in his municipality. He said that only a few households are facing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOnly a small number of people lack blankets and warm clothes in winter. We are preparing to distribute firewood to help people cope with the cold. A meeting to be held soon will decide on purchasing blankets,\u201d he says.</p>\n",

Then they crossed mountains and borders; they did not go as silent objects; they carried the heart of Nepal with them, building bridges of culture and spirit that lasted for centuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were the threads that tied us to the world with dignity and love. But today, that warmth has turned into something cold and hard. We are now packing up our &#8220;living heritage&#8221;, the very soul of our forests and sending it away to the scorching sands of the desert. When these gentle creatures weep, their tears are ignored by a government that chooses to see only a biological reaction rather than a<br>broken heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the night of December 17, 2025, this heavy change felt final. Two young souls, Rudrakali and Khagendra Prasad, born in the lush, green heart of Chitwan, landed in the heat of Doha. They travelled in the dark belly of a giant metal plane, carrying a weight of sadness far heavier than any cargo manifest could ever measure. While the state holds ceremonies to celebrate this &#8220;Wildlife Diplomacy,&#8221; those who watched the calves being forced into steel crates felt a deep ache. To the people, this did not look like a gift of friendship. It felt like a mechanical Kanyadan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tragedy of Rudrakali and Khagendra Prasad is written in their biology. An elephant\u2019s brain is a sanctuary of memory, containing a hippocampus, the part of the brain that processes emotions and long-term memory, so developed that it rivals the human capacity for grief. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When these calves were moved, they did not just leave a forest; they left a &#8220;sensory home.&#8221; While we are told they will adapt to the climate-controlled enclosures of Doha, no machine can replicate the deep, vibrating &#8220;social rumbles&#8221; of a matriarchal herd or the specific scent of a Chitwan monsoon. For an animal that remembers for decades, displacement is not a change of scenery; it is a lifelong exile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On paper, Nepal\u2019s promise to protect its wildlife is strong and unbreakable. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (1973) and the CITES Act (2017) list the Asian Elephant as a &#8220;Schedule I&#8221; species. This means they are supposed to have the highest level of legal protection possible. Under these laws, the state is not the &#8220;owner&#8221; of these living beings; it is their custodian, a guardian trusted to keep them safe. However, behind these strong words lies a hidden weakness. Animal welfare experts have long pointed out a legal trapdoor in the Fifth Amendment of the Wildlife Rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This small piece of fine print allows the government to bypass the very protections meant to keep elephants in their natural homes. The most troubling part is how these choices are made. Decisions to send elephants abroad often happen behind the closed doors of the Council of Ministers, far away from public discussion or expert debate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a gift like this is suddenly announced during a fancy state visit, it leaves us with a haunting question: Is this really about conservation, or are these living, breathing beings just a form of diplomatic currency used to buy favours for humans?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a biting irony in sending these calves to Qatar. Every day, the bodies of young Nepali migrant workers return from the Gulf in boxes; on December 17, we sent two of our most sacred animals to the same destination, also in boxes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One could view Rudrakali and Khagendra Prasad as Nepal\u2019s newest labourers. Just as millions of Nepalis go abroad to support the family back home, these elephants appear to have been sent to support the family of the state. While the public is shown a gift of friendship, we must wonder if such gestures are silently exchanged for invisible favours, the kind of quiet understandings that happen in the halls of power but are never written on the official gift tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a gift is used to settle an unspoken debt, is it still a gift, or is it a transaction? In true friendship, a gift is a spontaneous act of love. We have sent away two souls who will spend their long lives remembering a home that chose to trade them away. If diplomacy is the art of the yes, then sovereignty is the courage of the no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True diplomacy does not require the surrender of one&#8217;s heritage to maintain an alliance. It would mean standing before a powerful partner and asserting, &#8216;Our fifty-year bond is invaluable, but our wildlife is not a diplomatic asset. We will give you our expertise and our partnership, but we will not give you our souls.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A gift that is demanded is no gift at all, and a nation that cannot protect its most vulnerable has lost its compass. Scaling up our diplomacy means moving away from the symbolic sacrifice of animals and toward a relationship built on skills and professional exchange. We may take comfort in the fact that Rudrakali and Khagendra Prasad will receive high-end care in Qatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we must reflect on why such a traditional, heartbreaking method was necessary at all. If our diplomatic foundations were strong enough, we would not need to use the tears of a calf to cement a treaty. Let this be the final Kanyadan of its kind. Let our future diplomacy be written in ink, not in the displacement of those who cannot speak for themselves, but who will never, ever forget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The team has been training at the Upper Mulpani Cricket Ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having qualified for the Global Qualifier for the first time by crossing the Asia regional qualification stage, the Nepali team is now preparing with the goal of playing in the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s men\u2019s cricket team is set to play the T20 World Cup in India in about two months. At the same time, Nepal\u2019s women\u2019s cricket team is also preparing for the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier, which will be held in Nepal. As a result, public attention is now increasingly focused on women\u2019s cricket as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of the qualifiers, the <a href=\"https://cricketnepal.org.np/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://cricketnepal.org.np/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cricket Association of Nepal </a>(CAN) has appointed a new head coach. Indian-origin coach <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/harshal-jayant-pathak-head-coach.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/harshal-jayant-pathak-head-coach.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Harshal Jayant Pathak </a>has taken charge as the head coach of the Nepali women\u2019s team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to CAN\u2019s Cricket Operations Manager Binod Das, Pathak has been appointed for an initial term of two years. He previously coached Thailand\u2019s women\u2019s cricket team for a long period, and under his guidance, Thailand qualified for and played in the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathak\u2019s goal is now to help Nepal achieve the same feat. However, with limited time remaining, this will also be a challenging task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Indian coaches had previously served as consultants and batting coaches, this is the first time that a foreigner has been appointed as the head coach of the women&#8217;s cricket team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Jagat Tamata, Samsang Jung Thapa, Binod Das, and Manoj Katwal have worked as head coaches of the women\u2019s team, while India\u2019s Devika Palshikar and Manish Kumar Jha served as consultant coaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A new dimension in women\u2019s cricket</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CAN has stated that Pathak has been appointed not only to lead the senior women\u2019s team but to oversee women\u2019s cricket as a whole. The appointment of a full-time foreign coach for the women\u2019s team for the first time has added a new dimension to women\u2019s cricket in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur objective is to reform the overall women&#8217;s cricket team. He will be entirely involved with the junior and senior team, which is why we have referred to him as the Head of Women\u2019s Cricket,\u201d says Binod Das. \u201cHe will also have assistant coaches. His role will be the most crucial in women\u2019s cricket.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CAN had opened applications for coaches holding ECB or CA Level-3 certification (or equivalent) with at least five years of professional coaching experience. Accordingly, Pathak was appointed. With seven years of coaching experience in Thai cricket alone, Pathak said he saw great potential in Nepali women\u2019s cricket and was influenced by that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also said he observed strong intent in Nepal\u2019s batting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIntent is the most important thing. I see that intent and desire in Nepali players,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathak praised the cricketing environment in Nepal as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe cricket grounds are very good. I\u2019m excited and wanted to work with a good team,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve observed this team even as an opponent. I\u2019ve analysed their strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities. It\u2019s a passionate team, and working with such a team excites me. My goal is to identify talent and help them perform better.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said his focus would remain on the overall development of women\u2019s cricket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe development of women\u2019s cricket is the most important thing. From stepping up young players to strengthening bench strength, everything matters,\u201d he says. \u201cI will work in line with the vision of developing cricket from the junior level.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathak emphasised the importance of building a positive environment.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him, players must have a deep desire to win competitions. They need to understand that before the match, they are there to learn, but during the match, they must compete.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepali team captain Indu Barma considers Pathak\u2019s appointment as a positive step.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHis appointment is a very good thing for us. Ultimately, we are the ones who play, but working on skills with the coaches gives us added advantages,\u201d she says to Onlinekhabar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U-19 World Cup captain and current senior team vice-captain Puja Mahato also said Pathak is an excellent coach and expressed confidence that he could guide Nepal to the World Cup, just as he did with Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The goal is World Cup qualification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup Global Qualifier will be held in Nepal in January. Ten teams, including Nepal, will participate, with matches beginning on January 14 at the Mulpani Cricket Ground and Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground. Warm-up matches will be held on January 14 and 16, while the main matches will start on January 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal has been placed in Group B alongside Scotland, Thailand, the Netherlands, and Zimbabwe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the tournament is being held on home soil, Nepal\u2019s natural goal is to qualify for the World Cup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coach Pathak said that qualification for the World Cup is the immediate objective and expressed optimism about Nepal\u2019s chances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am positive that we can qualify. There are challenges, but this team has the capacity,\u201d he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain Indu Barma said that everyone in the team is working hard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are preparing with the mindset of pushing ourselves. We believe we must perform well on match day and do our best,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Puja Mahato echoes Barma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe focus is on how we can improve from before. This time, we must qualify at any cost,\u201d she says. \u201cI see this as an opportunity. Senior players have dreamed of the World Cup for a long time. This time, we will play the World Cup for them as well.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fitness-focused training, enthusiastic players</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, 20 players are in the women\u2019s team training camp. Fitness has been given top priority, and trainers have been appointed accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coach Pathak stressed the importance of fitness for improving fielding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe still need to work more on fielding, and for that, good fitness is essential. Work is ongoing in that direction,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former captain Rubina Chhetri said everyone is working hard to improve fitness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are working on fitness. We see it as something we must do, and everyone is putting in effort,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior-most player Sita Rana Magar also said preparations are going very well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPreparation has been excellent. The arrival of trainers has been very helpful,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Captain Indu to younger players, everyone is excited to play a home tournament.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the players, the combination of senior and young players has helped strengthen team balance and maturity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cThe mix of senior and young players is very beneficial,\u201d says Magar. Mahato also shared that she is getting opportunities to learn and stay motivated through the senior players.</p>\n",

It clarified that The Woolwich Institute (TWI), Dubai, is an independent educational institution operating legally under United Arab Emirates regulations and currently serving more than 300 students from over 25 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing concerns about its Foundation and Hospitality Management programmes, TBC said the courses are internationally recognised and designed to prepare students academically and professionally for higher education. Under the approved structure, Hospitality Management Foundation students are provided opportunities to pursue a Higher National Diploma (HND) at TWI, Dubai. Upon successful completion, eligible students may progress to Level 6 (Top-Up Bachelor\u2019s Degree) programmes in Dubai, the UK or Australia, subject to academic performance and visa regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The college clarified that while internship opportunities are facilitated to support skill development, internships are not guaranteed and this information is clearly communicated to students prior to enrolment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On accommodation in Dubai, TBC stated that temporary housing is arranged through third-party service providers to assist students during initial arrival. Students are required to make their own long-term accommodation arrangements thereafter, in line with international practice. The college denied allegations that students were abandoned or left homeless, calling such claims false and baseless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the return of some students to Nepal, TBC said nine out of approximately 51 Hospitality Management students returned after around three months due to personal dissatisfaction. The college said internships for these students were scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025, and that upon their return, the college immediately initiated formal consultations with students and parents. It stated that discussions were conducted transparently and constructively, and that the issues were progressing toward resolution through dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The college also accused certain individuals and external groups of misusing social media, spreading unverified allegations, obstructing campus activities, and engaging in vandalism and intimidation despite repeated invitations for formal dialogue. It said security assistance was sought to ensure the safety of students, staff and the academic environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TBC strongly denied allegations of exploitation or human trafficking, calling them defamatory and entirely false. It reaffirmed its commitment to legal, ethical and academic standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The college said student safety, dignity and long-term academic and professional development remain its top priorities. It added that all academic activities are continuing as scheduled, with no disruption to classes, assessments or examinations, and urged the public not to rely on unverified or misleading information.</p>\n",

Early Christians believed that March 25 was when Jesus was crucified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this theological assumption, the calculation shows that Jesus\u2019 conception also happened on March 25. This means, Jesus was born exactly nine months later, or on December 25. This theological-based calculation is known as\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23358685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Calculation Theory</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theory suggests Jesus\u2019s birth date has not linked to the pagan rituals to worship Sol Invictus, Saturnalia and Mithras, since the pagan feasts were not celebrated on December 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/5499535/Steven_Hijmans_Sol_Invictus_the_Winter_Solstice_and_the_Origins_of_Christmas_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sol Invictus</a>\u00a0was likely celebrated on August 8, 9, or 28, October 19 or 22, or December 11. <a href=\"https://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/58/58-2/JETS_58-2_299-324_Simmons.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Saturnalia</a>\u00a0was celebrated between December 17-23. As for\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-cult-of-mithras/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mithras</a>, there is no compelling evidence that it was celebrated on December 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The origins of Christmas celebrations</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Christmas-sweaters-_-Christmas-gift-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"Christmas sweaters _ Christmas gift ideas\" class=\"wp-image-514006\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Christmas-sweaters-_-Christmas-gift-ideas.jpg 1000w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Christmas-sweaters-_-Christmas-gift-ideas-300x200.jpg 300w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Christmas-sweaters-_-Christmas-gift-ideas-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Representational image.

The text mentions the celebration of the Epiphany, the manifestation of Christ to the ordinary people. The Catholic Church celebrates Epiphany to commemorate the visit of three wise men in Bethlehem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Eastern Orthodox and Orthodox churches celebrate the Epiphany to commemorate the baptism of Jesus. Epiphany is part of the Christmas feast in the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Orthodox Churches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/didascaliaaposto00gibsuoft/didascaliaaposto00gibsuoft/page/18/mode/2up?q=epiphany\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The <em>Didascalia</em> text states that</a>\u00a0Epiphany is celebrated every January 6 in the Julian calendar. When we convert this date to the Gregorian calendar, a solar calendar that has been widely used since\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/julian-gregorian-switch.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1582 CE</a>\u00a0until now, the Epiphany falls on December 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Liber Pontificalis</em>, which contains a short biography of the popes, suggests the celebration of Christmas in 2 century CE.\u00a0<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bookofpontiffsli0000unse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The text reveals</a>\u00a0that Pope Telesphorus (125-136 CE) instructed the celebration of Jesus\u2019s birth. The text does not mention the date of the festival. However,\u00a0<em>Liber Pontificalis</em>\u00a0proves that the Christmas celebration\u2019s history is older than we used to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/105846268/December_25th_and_the_Epistle_of_Theophilus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Epistle</a> of Theopilus\u00a0mentions December 25 as the date of the celebration of Jesus birth. The text suggests that the celebration was prior to 196 CE, thus, it is likely that Christmas has been celebrated before that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three texts above prove that the origin of Christmas is not Sol Invictus, Saturnalia, or Mithras celebrations, and that Christians have been celebrating Christmas since 2 century CE.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is republished from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Conversation</a>&nbsp;under a Creative Commons license.

He died on Tuesday at his residence in Biratnagar Metropolitan City\u20139.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandal was a former acting chairperson of the Nepal Sadbhavana Party (Nepal). A prominent royalist, he earned the trust of two former kings\u2014Birendra Bir Bikram Shah and his brother Gyanendra Shah\u2014and was repeatedly appointed to state responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2061 BS, Mandal became Minister for Agriculture with third seniority in the cabinet formed under King Gyanendra\u2019s leadership. After the establishment of the republic, he remained inactive in politics for a long period before returning to active politics through the Sadbhavana Party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandal, who served as Morang district chairperson at the time, first rose close to the royal family in 2038 BS and was appointed Assistant Minister for Finance. In 2043 BS, he also served as Minister for Law and Justice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe was an old and active leader from Morang. His signature is on my father\u2019s citizenship issued in 2032\u201333 BS,\u201d said JSP leader Jayaram Yadav. \u201cDuring the Panchayat era, he served as a minister several times.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the age of 88, Mandal had defeated senior Congress leader Shailaja Acharya from then Morang constituency No. 5 in the 2056 BS general election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Royalist leader Ballabh Prasad Dahal said Mandal was a leader trusted by both kings. \u201cHe created his own history. He served as a minister under two kings, and King Gyanendra even appointed him Deputy Prime Minister,\u201d Dahal said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dahal, Mandal was the first person from the Madhesi community to become both Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that when Mandal wielded strong influence in Biratnagar, Girija Prasad Koirala had attempted to bring him into the Nepali Congress, but Mandal refused. \u201cAfter the political change of 2046 BS, when Girija Prasad Koirala invited him to his residence, he did not go. Later, at a meeting at Badri Basnet\u2019s house, he again rejected the proposal to join the Congress,\u201d Dahal said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a powerful leader in eastern Nepal, Mandal gradually lost influence after the political change of 2046 BS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He returned to a royal appointment in 2061 BS but faded from prominence after the establishment of the republic. He later rejoined politics through the Sadbhavana Party founded by Gajendra Narayan Singh and remained aligned with royalist politics in the latter part of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandal is survived by two wives, four sons and three daughters. One of his sons had passed away earlier.</p>\n",

As the cold intensifies, most residents of Upper Mustang have migrated to lower regions to escape the harsh conditions, while a few remain behind to guard their homes and livestock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With most residents moving downhill for the winter, rural settlements in Lomanthang and Loghekar Damodarkunda rural municipalities have become largely deserted. Those who stay in the villages face increasing difficulty coping with the extreme cold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irregular electricity and communication services, along with freezing household water taps and septic tanks, have disrupted daily life. The cold also poses health risks to residents who remain in the area during winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To endure the winter, locals in Upper Mustang have increasingly relied on dung cakes as a source of fuel. Due to the dry plateau geography and lack of forests, firewood is scarce in the region. While electricity and gas are used during the monsoon season, residents traditionally dry livestock dung into dung cakes and use them as an energy source to get through winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pasang Gurung of Lomanthang-3, Thingar, said that as only one crop is grown annually in Upper Mustang, the practice of using dried animal dung as fuel has long been common. He explained that excess livestock dung, which is also used as manure, is dried in the sun and made into dung cakes for heating, boiling water and cooking food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large number of residents in Upper Mustang are engaged in yak, chauri and sheep farming. Locals regularly dry the dung of these animals in the sun to prepare dung cakes, a practice that has continued for centuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After drying, the dung cakes made from yak, chauri and sheep droppings are stored in sacks and used as needed for fuel, said Dhinduk Gurung of Lomanthang-2, Kimling. He added that dung cakes burn more efficiently than firewood, making them a convenient fuel for heating and cooking during winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Locals collect animal dung scattered in fields and grazing areas to make dung cakes. With this practice, dung cakes have become a reliable alternative to firewood in Upper Mustang, helping reduce the use of electricity and gas and contributing to household cost savings.</p>\n",

Through presentations, panels and case studies, participants will explore opportunities and challenges at grassroots levels, examine best practices, and address key issues such as inclusion and climate change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop responds to growing needs within Nepal\u2019s cultural heritage sector. While recent policy developments are beginning to reposition heritage as a driver of inclusive growth, practitioners often lack access to skills and platforms that connect heritage with sustainable income generation. Sectors such as tourism, craft and creative enterprises present strong opportunities for linking heritage protection with livelihoods, long-term sustainability and community benefit. This workshop seeks to strengthen that connection by supporting practitioners to design viable, impactful and locally grounded cultural heritage projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to 30 participants will engage in interactive sessions, practitioner talks and peer learning to build skills in designing, implementing and evaluating heritage projects. Up to 15 participants travelling from outside the Kathmandu Valley will receive financial support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCultural heritage is an integral part of Nepal\u2019s identity and could play a vital role in its future prosperity. This workshop creates an inclusive space for practitioners to enhance their skills, exchange knowledge, and develop impactful and sustainable projects that benefit communities across the country,\u201d said Nhooja Tuladhar, Head of Arts, British Council Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the workshop, participants will be better equipped to apply project management tools to cultural heritage initiatives, communicate their work effectively, and build meaningful connections with peers and stakeholders across Nepal\u2019s heritage ecosystem.</p>\n",

The revelation emerged while investigating one murder, which led police to discover another killing linked to the same suspects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police have arrested two people on murder charges: Devaraj Dhungel, also known as Ramesh, of Golanjor Rural Municipality, Sindhuli, and Jayaram Adhikari. The Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested them in coordination with the Lalitpur District Police Office and with assistance from the Sindhuli District Police.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to SSP Ramesh Basnet of the Crime Investigation Office, the two accused jointly killed 21-year-old Paruhang Rai of Bhojpur and Keshavraj Hayu of Golanjor-3, Sindhuli. Adhikari was arrested on Sunday evening with the help of Sindhuli Police and brought to Kathmandu at around 10 pm. Dhungel had been arrested earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police said the murders were primarily driven by unpaid loans. Investigators stated that Dhungel had sent his wife to Japan about four months ago, for which he had taken loans. To repay those debts, he later borrowed Rs 600,000 from his brother-in-law Keshavraj and Rs 500,000 from Paruhang. When both began demanding repayment, Dhungel allegedly planned and carried out the murders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe motive is clearly linked to debt. It appears the killings were committed to avoid repayment,\u201d SSP Basnet said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Killed in the forest on the pretext of an outing</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hayu-jwai-jethan-hatya-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577175\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhungel and the deceased Keshavraj were brothers-in-law. They had jointly leased land in Mahalakshmi Municipality-8, Sherphant, Lalitpur, to run an agricultural farm. Paruhang, who lived nearby, operated another farm in the same area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators said Dhungel had told the families of both lenders that the money was being handed over because he was going abroad, apparently to prevent suspicion if they later lost contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After planning the murder, Dhungel invited Keshavraj for an outing to a hill area. Jayaram Adhikari joined them, and the trio went to a forest in an area known as Jyamire in Lalitpur, where they consumed alcohol. After Keshavraj became intoxicated, he was allegedly struck with a hammer carried in a bag, killing him. His hands, legs and mouth were taped, and the body was left there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Second murder the following day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Believing he no longer needed to repay Keshavraj\u2019s loan, Dhungel then targeted Paruhang to be free of the remaining Rs 500,000 debt. Using a similar pretext, Paruhang was taken to a forest in Suryabinayak Municipality-7, on the Lalitpur\u2013Bhaktapur border, on Mangsir 25. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After he was intoxicated, he too was allegedly killed with a hammer. His body was taped, wrapped in plastic and thrown down a cliff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Body found a week later; slipper becomes key evidence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When both men went missing, their families filed complaints with the police. Meanwhile, the agricultural farm co-owned by Dhungel and Keshavraj had already been sold to Deepak Thapa Magar of Rolpa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workers later noticed a suspiciously large sack in a well at the Sherphant farm and informed police. Upon inspection, police recovered a body, which the family identified as Keshavraj\u2019s. At that point, there was still no information on Paruhang\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police intensified the investigation and grew suspicious of Dhungel, though he appeared to be actively assisting in the search. Keshavraj had been living with his girlfriend at the farm. After a dispute, he had gone to Sindhuli and did not return. During this period, his girlfriend damaged the shed in anger, and Dhungel recorded a video of the incident and even sent it to his wife in Japan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Keshavraj\u2019s body was recovered from the well on Poush 2, police also found a slipper nearby. Initially, its ownership was unclear. Later, the video of the shed being vandalised reached the police through relatives, and the slipper seen in the video matched the one found at the crime scene. This led police to identify the slipper as belonging to Dhungel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police then asked Dhungel to show his rented room in Bhaktapur. Though he initially tried to mislead officers, he eventually showed the room, where police found blood-stained clothes, a broken hammer and tape. The tape used to bind the body matched the tape recovered from his room, leading police to conclude that Dhungel had killed his brother-in-law, though he continued to deny the charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Arrest of Jayaram reveals second killing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite physical evidence, Dhungel denied involvement. Technical analysis, however, showed that another person had been present at the crime scene and had been in contact with Dhungel by phone. This led police to Jayaram Adhikari, who was arrested at his home in Golanjor, Sindhuli.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During initial questioning, Adhikari not only confessed to Keshavraj\u2019s murder but also revealed the killing of another person. He led police to a forest in Suryabinayak-7, where Paruhang\u2019s body was recovered. Police then confirmed that two murders had been committed within two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Body transported on motorcycle and dmped in well</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Police said Keshavraj was initially killed in the rural area of Jyamirkot, Lalitpur. Fearing the body would be discovered, the accused returned two days later, on Mangsir 26, packed the body in a sack, transported it on a motorcycle, and dumped it into the well at the farm they had sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDhungel rode the motorcycle, with the body placed in the middle and Jayaram seated behind, before dumping it into the well,\u201d SP Kajikumar Acharya said. The act was carried out around midnight. A motorcycle found in the bushes of Jyamirkot was later identified as one rented by the deceased Hayu for two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deal for Rs 200,000, paid only Rs 10,000</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Police said Dhungel and Adhikari were close friends. Dhungel had called Adhikari from Sindhuli to Kathmandu after planning the murders. Adhikari told police that Dhungel promised him Rs 200,000 to clear his own debt if he assisted in the killings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, after the murders, Dhungel allegedly paid him only Rs 10,000. \u201cHe promised Rs 200,000 but later gave me just Rs 10,000. After that, I returned home and stayed quietly,\u201d Adhikari was quoted by a police officer as saying.</p>\n",

On Sunday, after a welcome and a meeting at the party office, he held discussions with a government team led by Prime Minister Sushila Karki.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, he has already met Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah (Balen) twice. According to close sources, Balen and Lamichhane held one round of discussions on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Balen\u2019s side, his aides Kumar Ben and Nishchal Basnet participated in the discussion. From the RSP, Vice Chairperson DP Aryal and Central Committee member Asim Shah were present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One participant said that the meeting held on Monday focused on how the \u201cDesh Bikash Party,\u201d registered by Balen\u2019s close associates, and the RSP could move forward through cooperation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBoth yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s discussions have been considered positive,\u201d the source said. \u201cTalks are ongoing on how to cooperate.\u201d However, the source added that no conclusion has yet been reached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to close sources, there has been a proposal from Balen\u2019s side to cooperate to make Balen the prime ministerial candidate in the next election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They held discussions for both yesterday and today at the residence of Asim Shah in Kamalpokhari.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an RSP office-bearer, proposals for cooperation are coming in from various parties and groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are in talks with around ten different parties and groups,\u201d the office-bearer said. \u201cWe have agreed to move forward aggressively. Something new will come out in a couple of days.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leader said that some preparations made earlier had been put on hold while Chairperson Lamichhane was in prison, and that he has now increased political meetings to give concrete shape to those plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will not unite with those who calculate whether they might get one or two seats in a conditional election,\u201d the leader said. \u201cThere is no alternative to capable people with a genuine desire to do something coming together.\u201d</p>\n",

The exhibition \u201cHeritage Re-imagined,\u201d currently on display at Classic Gallery in Chyasal, Lalitpur, showcases works by 14 emerging artists who reinterpret Nepal\u2019s cultural legacy through modern artistic expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artists include Anjali Tamang, David Maharjan, Kabir Kayastha, Karima Joshi, Lachhen Nyarten Tamang, Prashamsha Shakya, Preeti Duwal, Rojiya Rai, Sarina Lamichhane, Sharmila Devi Tamang, Shrayam Shakya, Suresh Lawot Tuladhar, Yambang Thapa Magar and Moulik Limbu. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/588571260_1377089060873254_7891076150713231342_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577151\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the exhibition, artists Anjali Tamang, Lachhen Nyarten Tamang, and Prashamsha Shakya are presenting works that blend psychological introspection with spiritual and ecological themes. Tamang\u2019s paintings explore the human connection to the cosmos, while Shakya draws on folklore and lost landscapes to highlight the impact of urbanisation. Artist Preeti Duwal transforms domestic spaces into emotional narratives, and multimedia artist Sarina Lamichhane incorporates urban soundscapes, challenging audiences to reconsider overlooked elements of daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other contributors, such as Rojiya Rai and Sharmila Devi Tamang, examine resilience in marginalised spaces, whether through shadow, urban wildlife, or the adaptation of birds to city environments. Painters like Yambang Thapa Magar and Kabir Kayastha focus on landscapes and festivals, capturing both natural and cultural transformations in Nepal. Likewise </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through diverse mediums, including watercolour, sculpture, multimedia, and traditional carving, the artists collectively engage viewers in reflections on personal memory, ecological balance, and cultural continuity. The exhibition underscores a growing trend among young Nepali artists: honouring heritage while fearlessly experimenting with form, theme, and narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHeritage Re-imagined\u201d will be open at Classic Gallery, Chyasal, Lalitpur, until December 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2256\" height=\"4000\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577152\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577154\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577155\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577158\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577159\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577165\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577164\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-22.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577163\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577162\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-16-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577160\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2256\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577157\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1744\" height=\"2896\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unnamed-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577166\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Photos: Sangita Shrestha</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Following the discovery, the rural municipality has announced plans to conduct a second phase of technical and scientific studies during a weather-friendly season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the municipal office, the survey will be carried out with the participation of concerned agencies. Chame Rural Municipality Chairperson Lokendra Bahadur Ghale said the study will include satellite measurements, hydrological tests, and environmental risk assessments. The objective is to develop long-term plans for conservation, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable management in coordination with local communities after the survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chairperson Ghale said that preliminary measurements indicate the lake could potentially be established as the world\u2019s highest large lake, prompting the municipality to move forward with the survey process at the national level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on information provided by local residents and herders, a joint team comprising Chame Rural Municipality, Nepal Police, local representatives, and then Chief District Officer Suprabha Khanal Dhungel estimated the lake\u2019s surface elevation at approximately 5,200 meters above sea level. Ghale said a detailed study is essential and, if confirmed as the highest, Nepal should formally claim and promote it internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lake is located in an extremely remote Himalayan terrain. Although access is difficult due to harsh trails, weather conditions, altitude, and risky geography, preliminary findings suggest Kajin Sara Lake should be promoted as a significant natural heritage not only of Manang but of the country as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The municipality stated that formal scientific verification of the lake\u2019s elevation, area, and depth is still pending. Chairperson Ghale expressed confidence that the lake would open a new chapter in Manang\u2019s tourism sector. Plans are underway to prioritise safe trekking routes, alternative access trails, tourist-friendly infrastructure, and environmental conservation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that the area is biologically and geographically sensitive, making environmental impact assessments mandatory for any planned development. According to Ghale, local herders had long reported sightings of a distant blue water body while grazing yaks, sheep, and goats in the Singarkhark hills and meadows. Based on their information, exploratory work initiated by the municipality in 2078 BS estimated the lake\u2019s length at around one kilometre and width at about 600 meters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Chief District Officer Dhungel had conducted an aerial survey of the area by helicopter to assess the lake. However, its depth has yet to be measured. Preliminary reports describe the lake as a high-altitude glacial lake formed by meltwater from Himalayan glaciers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lake is surrounded by prominent mountain ranges\u2014Manaslu to the east, Annapurna and Lamjung Himal to the south, Damodar Himal to the west, and Tibet\u2019s Peri Himal to the north\u2014making Kajin Sara Lake visually striking. Local tourism entrepreneurs believe it could be developed as a tourist destination in coordination with Tilicho Lake, the Annapurna Circuit, and the Nar\u2013Phu region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kajin Sara Lake is currently seen as a potential challenger to Tilicho Lake, widely regarded as the world\u2019s highest lake. Preliminary measurements suggest Kajin Sara Lake lies nearly 300 meters higher than Tilicho Lake, which stands at 4,919 meters. Experts say it is natural for previously unidentified high-altitude glacial lakes to emerge due to geological uplift, glacier expansion, and gradual changes in water sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narpa Bhumi Rural Municipality Chairperson Konjo Tenzing Lama said that although Narpa Bhumi is officially the highest rural municipality in Nepal, no definitive conclusion on Kajin Sara Lake can be drawn until an official survey is conducted by the Department of Survey. He added that Kajin Sara Lake being listed as the world\u2019s highest lake would be a matter of pride for all residents of Manang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Residents have emphasised the need for government attention toward the study and survey of the lake. If scientific studies and official recognition are completed, Nepal is expected to formally claim Kazinsara Lake as the world\u2019s highest lake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2014RSS</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Among various MCC-funded projects, the road improvement project has been awarded entirely to a Nepali joint venture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 40-kilometre Dhankhola\u2013Lamahi road recycling project, to be built under the MCC grant, was awarded through a global tender to the Sharma\u2013Kumar JV. The project is being implemented by MCA-Nepal with funding from the MCC grant and investment from the Government of Nepal. Contracts for transmission lines and substations under the MCC program had already been awarded earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contract for the road, based on Full Depth Reclamation and Superpave Asphalt technology, being used in Nepal for the first time on a pilot basis, is scheduled to be signed on Monday. Bids for the project were invited in October 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of 11 construction companies that submitted proposals, Sharma\u2013Kumar JV was selected. The joint venture consists of Sharma Construction and Kumar Nirman Sewa Pvt Ltd, and it is the first fully Nepali joint venture to secure a construction contract among MCC-implemented projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Nepali companies had won transmission line contracts only through joint ventures with foreign firms. This marks the first instance of a contract being awarded exclusively to Nepali companies, according to government sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharma\u2013Kumar JV secured the contract for USD 20.8 million, excluding VAT (approximately Rs 3 billion). Companies from Nepal, India, and Ukraine had competed for the project. Of the bidders, four\u2014including Sharma\u2013Kumar JV, Kalika Construction, Tundi\u2013Ashish JV, and Swachchhanda\u2013Raman JV\u2014were fully Nepali-owned. Other Nepali companies had participated in joint ventures with Indian and Ukrainian firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following technical and financial evaluations of all 11 bidders, Sharma\u2013Kumar JV was selected for the project. The Ministry of Finance described it as significant that a Nepali company secured a contract involving advanced road construction technology being used in Nepal for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy and road infrastructure projects are being implemented under the MCC program with USD 550 million in grants from the MCC and a contribution of USD 197 million from the Government of Nepal. Initially, the MCC compact signed between Nepal and the United States committed USD 500 million, with Nepal contributing USD 130 million. Nepal later increased its contribution due to funding shortfalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the transmission line project still faced funding gaps, the MCC Board decided on January 2 to provide Nepal with an additional USD 50 million and informed the US Congress. After Donald Trump assumed office as US President, MCC assistance underwent a review. While the US later confirmed continued implementation of MCC projects and the original USD 500 million grant, it initially made no mention of the additional USD 50 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Mangsir 3, the US Embassy in Nepal issued a statement confirming that Nepal would also receive the additional USD 50 million. Contracts have already been awarded for three substations and 315 kilometres of transmission lines under the MCC grant. Construction of an 18-kilometre transmission line from the New Butwal substation to the Indian border has also begun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the MCC program, 400 kV substations are being constructed in Damauli (Tanahun), Ratmate (Nuwakot), and Nawalparasi. In addition, 315 kilometres of transmission lines, divided into four section,s are under construction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MCA project, which must be completed within five years or risk forfeiture of the US grant, came into force on 13 Bhadra 2080. From the date of entry into force, a five-year countdown begins, after which any unspent funds will be returned to the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, two years, eight months, and eight days have elapsed since the project entered into force. According to foreignassistance.gov, commitments amounting to USD 471.3 million (approximately Rs 66 billion) were created in 2023 and 2024 under the MCC\u2019s USD 550 million grant pledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MCC compact was signed between the Government of Nepal and the MCC on 29 Bhadra 2074. However, due to prolonged political debate in Nepal over its implementation, it took more than four and a half years for Parliament to ratify the compact. It was finally endorsed with an interpretative declaration on 15 Falgun 2078, and MCC project implementation formally began on 13 Bhadra 2080, six years after the agreement was signed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Along with this, various Gen Z groups have begun evaluating the government\u2019s actions and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some Gen Z groups are dissatisfied with the government, others say it should focus on holding elections in line with its mandate. Some of the dissatisfied groups have even begun preparations to intensify street protests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miraj Dhungana, who was not seen on the streets during the days of the Gen Z movement, held a press conference on Sunday and said he would now take to the streets. The group led by Dhungana announced a movement demanding the formation of an all-party government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the conference in Kathmandu, the Dhungana alliance said the current government had betrayed the spirit of the Gen Z movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhungana claimed that the government led by Sushila Karki has already failed based on its 100 days of performance and said protests would begin from Monday (December 22).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-Nepalese-Gen-Z-Protests\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/2025-Nepalese-Gen-Z-Protests\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gen Z movement </a>of September was not meant to build anyone\u2019s brand or serve as a ladder for leaders. No one should try to rise by stepping on the movement. The current government led by Sushila Karki does not carry the spirit of the movement and does not represent our leadership,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is why an all-party government must now be formed. What the country needs today is political leadership that can take all sides into confidence and provide an exit for the nation.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhungana claimed that the government led by Sushila Karki has failed to uphold the spirit of the movement. \u201cThe Gen Z movement was not launched to hold elections two years before the scheduled time. This government does not appear to be providing any solution. Why is Sushila so fixated on elections?\u201d he asks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dhungana\u2019s argument against going to elections is not based solely on an evaluation of the government\u2019s 100 days. Although he made such claims at the press conference, he had been saying from the beginning that this government should be brought down and form a new one. On October 18, when he held a press conference at the Everest Hotel announcing plans to form a party, he argued that they had not formed a party to contest elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even then, Dhungana had said that this government\u2019s mandate was not to conduct elections. According to him, since the government was formed to move forward by amending the constitution on important issues, it did not have the mandate to hold elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf the current government thinks it will become an election government, that is an illusion. The purpose of this government is not to hold elections in the current situation,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having opposed elections from the very beginning, Dhungana is now determined to go for a movement by forming a coalition. Harish Bhatt, close to Dhungana, said the Gen Z coalition preparing for protests consists of 26 groups. He said details about the groups involved would be made public soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gen Z Front: Elections are necessary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gen Z Front says that elections, rather than protests, are the need of the moment. According to the group led by Raksha Bam, there is no alternative to elections at present, and the government should focus on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Front leader Yujan Rajbhandari said they are also preparing accordingly and plan to support independent candidates emerging from the organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He argued that they would not support movements launched with the backing of other forces and said protests aimed at disrupting elections are not justified in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are not in favour of protests. We should not get trapped in the chaos of toppling the government and forming another one in the name of an all-party setup,\u201d Rajbhandari says. \u201cThis government must now conduct the elections, and we should support that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that if anyone from their group wishes to contest elections independently, they would support them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elections are essential for an exit: Gen Z Movement Alliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gen Z Movement Alliance also says there is no alternative to elections in the current situation and that it is not in favour of protests. According to alliance leader Monika Niraula, they are not involved in the movement being proposed by the Miraj Dhungana group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, she urged everyone to understand the situation and support elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhoever is talking about launching protests, we are not involved in that. In the current situation, we are firm that elections must be held,\u201d Niraula says. \u201cHowever, protesting is a constitutional right. If they choose to protest, we have nothing to say against it. But we only request that a mature decision be taken after understanding the current context.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niraula also argued that the demand raised by the Dhungana group for immediate constitutional amendment is not practical at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No alternative to elections: The Council of Gen Z</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders of The Council of Gen Z say that there can be no better alternative than elections in the current situation. According to Koshi Province coordinator Uparjun Chamling, the Council of Gen Z believes elections should not be avoided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose who are announcing protests, are they really Gen Z? The public is aware. Everyone has seen who is who,\u201d Chamling says. \u201cWe are not chasing such theatrics. In the current situation, there is no better or more beautiful option than elections.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"511\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pm-Genz-1024x511-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577135\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinting at Miraj Dhungana, Chamling adds, \u201cThose who ran away from the streets during the Gen Z movement yesterday, why are they now saying they will come to the streets today? The public understands this clearly.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that without elections, the country risks heading down two paths, and Gen Z citizens who care about the nation will not support that. Without elections, the country could move either toward authoritarian forces or toward the restoration of parliament, he said. Therefore, Gen Z must be clear about what it wants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s youth want neither authoritarian rule nor the restoration of a parliament that hands power back to the same old thuggish gangs,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is why there is no alternative to elections right now.\u201d</p>\n",

The committee plans to install trash barriers at a total of six locations\u2014Gokarna Barrage, Guhyeshwari, Tilganga Eye Hospital, the Bagmati\u2013Manohara confluence, UN Park, and the Karmanasha confluence of the Manohara River. A contract worth Rs 6.5 million has been awarded for the project, and work is currently underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trash barriers are designed to trap floating waste such as plastic, polythene, bottles and pieces of wood, directing them to a designated collection point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to rapid urbanisation and poor waste management, large volumes of floating waste flow through rivers such as the Bagmati, Bishnumati, Manohara and Dhobikhola in the Kathmandu Valley. Installing trash barriers in these rivers allows waste to be removed without obstructing the natural flow of water, thereby helping to reduce river pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The waste collected through the barriers can be regularly removed, segregated, reused and safely managed. This is expected to contribute to pollution control, enhance river aesthetics, protect aquatic life and improve public health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The barriers will be installed with structures that include rubber conveyor belts and floating components, allowing them to trap floating waste without blocking river flow and automatically adjust up and down with changes in water levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

I cannot understand why prices have risen so sharply,\u201d she said, adding that continued price hikes would force households to cut expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the wholesale price of small eggs being fixed at Rs 464.28 per crate since Mangsir 23, consumers are paying up to Rs 25 per egg. Based on the wholesale rate, the retail price should not exceed Rs 17 per egg, but retailers are selling eggs at significantly inflated prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers have complained that regulatory bodies such as the Department of Commerce, Supply and Consumer Protection have failed to conduct market monitoring or take action, allowing widespread overpricing to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arjun Bhandari of Babarmahal said he had to pay as much as Rs 520 per crate for small eggs. When he questioned shopkeepers about charging more than the fixed rate, they cited egg shortages or refused to sell. \u201cEven by calculation, small eggs cost Rs 24\u201325 per piece. We rarely see medium or large eggs in shops and are forced to pay the price of large eggs for small ones,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Repeated price hikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous month alone, the Nepal Layers Poultry Farmers Association revised egg wholesale prices four times. On 10 Kartik, the association fixed prices at Rs 500 per crate for large eggs and Rs 450 for medium eggs. It then revised prices on 3, 7, 13 and 23 Mangsir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 3 Mangsir, prices were set at Rs 450 for large eggs, Rs 435 for medium eggs and Rs 2,600 per box for small eggs. On Mangsir 7, prices were raised again, fixing XL eggs at Rs 520 per crate, large at Rs 505, medium at Rs 490 and small eggs at Rs 3,150 per box. On 13 Mangsir, prices increased by another Rs 40 per crate for XL, large and medium eggs, while small eggs rose by Rs 100 per box. On Mangsir 23, prices were raised again by Rs 20 per crate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between Mangsir 3 and 23, egg prices increased by 11.54 to 26.44 per cent across categories, directly affecting household kitchens. Small eggs alone rose by about 25 per cent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Allegations of cartelisation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumer rights activist Madhav Timilsina said associations fixing prices of agricultural products are illegal and constitute cartelisation. \u201cFixing prices four times in a single month violates prevailing laws, the Consumer Protection Act and the Constitution,\u201d he said, accusing government bodies of remaining silent despite being aware of the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Association\u2019s response</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Association Chairperson Binod Pokharel claimed the group does not fix prices but only recommends a \u201csupport price\u201d based on production costs and market conditions. He attributed the price rise to increased feed, medicine and operational costs, lower winter production and a decline in the number of farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dispute over production cost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent expert committee report estimated the cost of producing one egg at Rs 19.12, up from Rs 16.56 previously. However, some farmers dispute this figure, claiming production costs are only Rs 14\u201315 per egg and alleging price manipulation by large producers and middlemen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Livestock Services said egg prices are determined by the private sector and market forces, though it is willing to facilitate discussions if stakeholders seek coordination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As egg prices continue to rise, consumers remain burdened while questions persist over regulation, transparency and accountability in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

However, times have changed. Today, bhajans are increasingly finding a place in the playlists of young people, and some youngsters have even begun organising bhajan events where youth gather to enjoy and connect through devotional music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar scene was witnessed on November 29 during the ninth episode of <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em> organised by <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/yagyashala-vedic-rituals-astrology.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/yagyashala-vedic-rituals-astrology.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yagyashala</a>. To savour the village-like essence of bhajans and <em>kirtans</em>, people gathered at the Dabali of Nepal Academy in Kamaladi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt had been so long since I sat in such an atmosphere, it cured my homesickness for the village,\u201d says an audience member. \u201cI wish events like this, well managed and blending traditional culture with modernity, could happen all the time.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audience was not limited to villagers who had moved to the city. From actress Srishti Shrestha to singer-songwriter Ujjwal Saagar, the presence of well-known figures made the November evening feel warm and lively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same evening, Guru Chalisey was also present. He attends Yagyashala\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bhajansanjh/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.instagram.com/bhajansanjh/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bhajan Sanjh</a> whenever he can. In his experience, such events offer relief to people who are always busy with work.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI come to every Bhajan Sanjh,\u201d he said. \u201cThis program makes me deeply joyful.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"690\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yagya-Shala-Bhajan-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577110\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are young people drifting away from our culture? This very question inspired Nirjan Adhikari to become the founder of Yagyashala. \u201cSince I personally enjoy spirituality, I formed a team and began working,\u201d he recalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explaining why Yagyashala was launched in 2022, Nirjan adds, \u201cWhen we saw young people moving away from their culture and traditions, the idea of how to spark their interest and preserve culture became the foundation of this initiative.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To draw young people toward their own traditions, the team adopted a strategy, making worship and bhajans youth-friendly. Without altering their essence, they began presenting rituals in a modern way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various studies show that stress levels among youth are increasing. With the growing use of the internet, social media, and work pressure, it\u2019s inevitable that they feel exhausted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhikari says, \u201cThere are options like clubs and discos, but they don\u2019t carry our culture. So we introduced the concept of <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em>, something that preserves culture while offering a clubbing-like experience.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also an economic aspect. Bhajan singers do not earn well. According to musicians in the field, it\u2019s difficult to make money through this genre, which increases the risk of such creations gradually disappearing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhikari says, \u201cWe realised the need for a platform where cultural preservation, spirituality, and mental health go hand in hand with decent earnings for bhajan musicians.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"422\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yagya-Shala-Bhajan-1-1-768x422-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577111\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 1, 2024, they organised the first edition of Bhajan Sanjh at Yagyashala\u2019s own hall with around 50 participants. All expenses were carried out by Yagyashala, including artists\u2019 fees, sound systems and decoration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its inception, Yagyashala aimed to make this initiative professional, not merely entertaining, but meaningful and attractive. Initially, entry was free. Fifty people attended the first Bhajan Sanjh; the number doubled in the second episode.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When 100 people attended the second episode, the team became even more enthusiastic. They began experimenting, adding microphones, using flowers, designing invitation cards, promoting on social media, and so on. Just like attractive city clubs, they started giving people special invitations and creating a similar ambience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Adhikari, who studied parapsychology, good music heals people and is an effective way to reduce stress. That\u2019s why he sees <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em> as an alternative form of mental health therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCounselling is a Western method, but in our culture, <em>kirtan</em> and bhajan are age-old healing practices,\u201d Adhikari says. \u201cThat\u2019s why this is even more essential for our changing society. Beyond that, it\u2019s a bridge that promotes social unity and culture while connecting youth with spirituality.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the ninth edition, Yagyashala finally introduced ticketing, Rs. 500 per person. This was a new experiment, and the organizers did worry whether people would come if they had to pay. But during the ninth episode of the Bhajan Sanjh, around 350 participants gathered at Pragya Dabali to immerse themselves in the bhajan evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Yagyashala had been hosting events in its own hall.&nbsp; Adhikari said that attendees at Pragya showed even more interest, asking when the next evening would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt went much better than we expected. Data already showed that youth are interested in spirituality; this event confirmed it,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhikari\u2019s personal experience further strengthens the initiative. He has experienced clubs and various \u201cfancy night dinners.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPersonally, clubs are fun at first, but later they become tiring. Ultimately, people seek peace,\u201d he says. \u201cBhajans gave me personal healing.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"707\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yagya-Shala-Bhajan-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577113\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Singer Nishu Sharma, who performed at the ninth Bhajan Sanjh, joined by coincidence. Seeing videos of <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em> on social media sparked her interest. Then the opportunity arose, and she ended up performing. While dreaming of swaying along, she instead got the chance to make others sway at Pragya Dabali.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy friend Ravi is part of the Bhajan Sanjh team. I was very happy when he offered me the chance to sing,\u201d Sharma says enthusiastically. \u201cI had said I\u2019d go anywhere just to listen, and suddenly I was performing. Yagyashala is giving a platform to singers like us.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharma has now joined the Yagyashala team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThe dream is to provide a platform for new talents and commercialise good traditional culture,\u201d Nirjan says. \u201cWe want people to be able to live comfortably by singing bhajans, just like other music genres, and see it as a career. That\u2019s also our dream.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it looks exciting in the ninth edition, the beginning was not easy. When Adhikari first shared the idea with relatives, he was humiliated even within his own circle. When Yagyashala was established, he heard comments like, \u201cHe\u2019s gone crazy, he would end up doing nothing with this bhajan and kirtan\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But over the past two years, responses have changed. People have begun viewing it positively, and the influence of <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em> is growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this journey, Ravi Pandey has consistently supported Adhikari and the team. Pandey oversees overall management. From the sound system to everything that enhances the audience\u2019s experience, Adhikari says Ravi and other colleagues play a major role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are interested in going out in the evening but can\u2019t go to clubs, <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em> has become a meaningful alternative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt has created a path for families to come together for \u2018bhajan clubbing.\u2019 It has built a beautiful bond among family and society. I\u2019m extremely happy with all these things,\u201d Adhikari says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One message that Nirjan often remembers reads, \u201cI came out of my house after two months to attend <em>Bhajan Sanjh</em>. Thank you, brother!\u201d</p>\n",

To raise awareness about meditation and its benefits, the UN General Assembly proclaimed 21 December as World Meditation Day last year, recalling the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the occasion, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is scheduled to host an event at Sainik Manch Tundikhel in Kathmandu this morning. Similarly, a group meditation program including interaction on various aspects of meditation is being held at Brahmananda Saraswati Gram in Bosan, Dakshinkali Municipality-1. Marking the occasion, various other stakeholder bodies are also hosting a variety of programs today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises the significant benefits of meditation, particularly mindfulness meditation. The WHO&#8217;s discussions on stress management underscore the importance of learning coping mechanisms, such as meditation, to support mental and physical well-being. According to the WHO, meditation can be a powerful self-care tool to support treatment and enhance overall well-being, particularly in managing symptoms of anxiety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating mindfulness meditation into your daily routine, even for just a few minutes, can help you achieve a sense of calm and focus. Additionally, WHO acknowledges the mental health benefits of practices like yoga, which often incorporate meditative elements.</p>\n",

However, as this pattern increases, it can begin to affect daily life. Such problems can occur when the brain gradually loses its functional capacity. As we age, the condition of the brain does not remain the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, this issue is not limited to old age. It can also be seen in children, adolescents, and young adults. If brain function weakens at these stages, it can directly affect their work, studies, and career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can this be prevented? And how can brain function be improved?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multivitamins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, taking a daily multivitamin is beneficial for brain health. It helps support brain function and enhances abilities such as reading, writing, learning, and memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deep Sleep</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting adequate and deep sleep is essential. Researchers from the American Academy of Neurology have found that sleep quality plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and optimal brain function. Good, deep sleep helps keep the brain fresh and alert.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exercise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark conducted a study on men aged 18 to 35. They found that those who exercised before engaging in mental tasks showed improved performance and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coffee</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several studies suggest that drinking coffee can also improve brain function. According to a study by Johns Hopkins University, participants who were given a 200-milligram caffeine tablet demonstrated comparatively better memory performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Foods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain foods such as mushrooms, dark chocolate, and cinnamon are also known to help improve brain function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

She calls out, \u201cSon, fix the electricity quickly. I need to heat ghee.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A stout, teenage Nepali boy stands in front of a switch, with an electricity meter on each side. One has a glass case covering it, the other a cracked plastic case. He asks, \u201cPradhikaran ki local?\u201d This is a small tea shop off the highway in Baglung, but it could be anywhere outside metropolitan Nepal. The reality of Nepal\u2019s energy demand outside metropolitan areas is so high that households need multiple energy sources. People do this by supplementing the electricity from a local supply source, mostly Micro Hydropower Plants (MHP) in Baglung, with another connection to NEA\u2019s national grid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days later in Nisi, while eating lunch, I learned that most households there typically have at least three appliances. A fridge, a standing fan, a television, and a few households even have electric cookstoves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fridge looked just like the one in my dormitory\u2019s kitchen. A simple metal fridge with a single door. The fan, a small standing red fan, is like the one in my dorm room. But the TV, that was different. It was an old Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) television, covered in dust, with the plug kept on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This intrigued me, so as the restaurant owner in Nisi took my plate, I asked her, \u201cWhy is the TV so dusty and unplugged?\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She replied, \u201cWhy plug it in? We don\u2019t need it. My husband and daughter are the only ones who watch videos, and they watch on their phones.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind me was a little girl, hunched on a little plastic stool, glued to her phone, watching a cartoon. Behind a wooden wall, her father sat outside in a similar position on a similar plastic stool, watching what I could only make out to be local Nepali news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEither way, we don\u2019t have two sources of electricity. How could we have enough electricity to plug it in?\u201d she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TVs across low-income houses in rural Nepal sit in the corner, gathering dust, a reflection of the lack of energy reliability. Why? Because energy supply is so unreliable, people choose not to use their appliances. \u201cLoad shedding,\u201d as the NEA called it. The idea that I, the user, must sacrifice power, not use my appliance, so that the overall grid can remain stable. People have gotten so used to load shedding that their lifestyle has evolved to become independent of their appliances. This is the failure of NEA to meet the energy demands of its people, despite having abundant electricity, and an inability to effectively connect small-scale energy sources to the national grid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal has a lot of rivers. And in those rivers lie over 3000 small scale Micro Hydropower Plants. Out of these, fewer than 20 are connected to the national grid. This means extreme economic inefficiency. People outside metropolitan areas are forced to invest in multiple energy sources to fulfil what Nthe EA is not fulfilling- energy supply reliability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thulo Muwa wants to buy a higher-capacity electric cookstove for her chia store. But she is burdened by having to pay for two electricity sources- the local line (coming from micro hydropower plants) and the \u2018pradhikaran\u2019 line (from the national grid), all so she can have a reliable energy supply. This takes so much budget away from her other expenses in the chai pasal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This inefficiency exists because of the narrative in Nepal Energy Authority\u2019s offices, where there is enough reliable energy supply to run a constant AC. The narrative says that \u2018there isn\u2019t enough energy demand\u2019 in rural areas to change the current structure to a more reliable system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Connecting many small scale MHP\u2019s to the national grid would help improve the electricity supply. That way, people don\u2019t need multiple meters and distribution lines. A singular line would be reliable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I write this article from my dorm room in the US, I am struck with admiration to see what Nepal has evolved into. The Gen-Z movement has worked so hard for such a beautiful idea, toppling corruption in the government and allowing for a new path forward. To fulfil this idea, we must work towards holistic change. We established a new, anti-corruption government, and we are working so hard on bringing reform to urban constituencies. So now, let\u2019s pave the path for energy policy reform in rural areas. Let\u2019s fulfil the promises we made when the Singha Durbar was burned down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, the reality of NEA\u2019s failure is that only a handful of small-scale energy systems are connected to the national grid. The rest of them just wait in the hope that, pradhikaran ko dai (staff of NEA) will come and connect the MHP\u2019s next months.</p>\n",

For him, the Trishuli River was not just a source of water; from the very beginning of his life, it was his first teacher, silent, yet profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While his friends sat inside the classroom, he would hide his schoolbag in the bushes and run towards the water. Even when the school bell called him back, the waves of the Trishuli called out louder. Sometimes, the deepest life lessons are taught not by classrooms, but by nature. For Udhav Kadel, this truth had already revealed itself in childhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time changed, circumstances changed, but the boy\u2019s bond with the river never did. Today, that same boy has become a well-known figure in Nepal\u2019s adventure tourism sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had never imagined that what was once seen as \u201cundisciplined\u201d behaviour, tricking teachers and running to the river, would one day form the foundation of the most disciplined decisions of his life. After completing Grade 12, Udhav went to Europe to study hotel management. Once he stepped onto foreign soil, he began to realise that earning money alone is not the sole purpose of going abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his difficult years in Europe, he deeply experienced the value of self-discipline, compassion, and hard work. Working morning to evening in unfamiliar surroundings and amid hardships, his understanding of life gradually deepened. \u201cDreams are not created by countries; dreams are born from courage,\u201d he reflected while living there. Beyond earnings, he learned one lesson that mattered most: the art of becoming a better human being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many Nepalis who have settled in Europe or the United States, the desire to return home is often seen as unnecessary sentimentality, even interpreted as foolishness. But for Udhav, the urge to return was not stubbornness; it was a call from within. He returned because he knew his future lay right there, on the riverbank that had spoken to him since childhood. He was aware of the risks, uncertainty, an unclear future, and incomplete plans. Yet sometimes, the desire to do something meaningful grows so strong that even risks begin to feel small.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Zipline.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577088\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After returning to Nepal, he chose a path many considered impossible: the rafting business. What began with one or two boats gradually expanded and became a trusted name among domestic and international tourists. The Trishuli remains the same old friend to Udhav, never deceptive, never trapping, but always teaching in countless ways. The river gets angry, the weather changes, tourists come and go, but courage born in water is tested in water. This belief kept him moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is not just a businessperson, but someone who works like a campaigner. His goal was never limited to personal success. He trained local youth, produced guides, purchased local farm produce, and connected the community with tourism. As a result, local people became equal stakeholders in his success. He understood one simple truth: where roots are planted, the tree grows strongest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rafting alone could not fulfil his vision. He saw a bigger picture, creating accommodation along the Trishuli that would feel like a home for travellers. Initially, tourists were hosted in tented camps. Gradually, this evolved into cottage rooms and then a modern building. A swimming pool, DJ hall, and deck restaurant were added over time. In essence, Udhav reinvested his earnings back into the same riverbank. This is how Trishuli Riverside Resort was born. His ancestral land by the river has been beautifully transformed through his sweat and dedication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, he did not stop there. He purchased land across the resort. During the COVID-19 period, when many tourism entrepreneurs were paralysed by uncertainty, he resumed construction. The result was a more premium property than the original resort, <a href=\"https://trishulivilla.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trishuli Villa.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A zipline and sky cycling now connect Trishuli Villa and Trishuli Riverside Resort. Investing Rs 100 million during a time when the world was struggling with COVID-19 is not a decision just anyone can make. To many, it seemed like a risk; to Udhav, it was a brick laid in the foundation of self-confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were days when disasters like earthquakes and the pandemic forced him to lose as much as he had gained. In such moments, he sometimes questioned himself: \u201cWas returning from abroad a mistake?\u201d But the waves of the Trishuli have always given him just one answer: \u201cColliding is not misfortune; continuing to flow is destiny.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Udhav\u2019s life story is not merely a tale of personal success. It is an answer to a question that echoes in the minds of thousands of Nepalis living abroad: where, and for whom, do dreams truly come true? There is no single answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trishuli-Riverside-resord.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577089\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gathering skills, discipline, and experience abroad and then returning with the courage to build something at home is not common but people like Udhav prove that it is possible. Their journey says: the country may be difficult, but it is full of possibilities. If there is courage to work, the river\u2019s waves themselves carve the path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For young people who want to do something meaningful, Udhav stands as a quiet source of inspiration. It is good for dreams to be frightening, because frightening dreams often define the direction of life. The mental strength of a boy who grew up playing with water along the Trishuli River is what allows him today to inspire thousands, where the heart is committed, the path begins to shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"625\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trishuli-Villa-1-1024x625-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577090\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u2014By Brahma Kant Ghimire</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

According to the Hospital\u2019s Medical Superintendent, Dr Nirajan Subedi, the service has been introduced using newly acquired advanced testing equipment. In the past two days, four newborns have already been tested for sickle cell disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hospital also operates a 16-bed ward dedicated to sickle cell patients. Dr Rajan Pandey said that the lack of early diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia often leads to the untimely death of children. If a newborn is diagnosed with sickle cell disease, additional vaccinations are required up to the age of five, starting from three months, along with regular medication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timely diagnosis makes treatment easier and more effective. Although sickle cell anaemia is predominantly prevalent among the Tharu community, cases have also been detected in other communities. The test for newborns is conducted with the consent of parents or guardians.</p>\n",

The High Court order states that since liability will be determined as per the final verdict, he must agree in writing to pay any additional amount if such liability is created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Third condition:</strong> The High Court stated that the amount set by the district court as bail and the proportional amount of potential compensation must be submitted through a bank guarantee. However, since Lamichhane had already submitted this earlier, it does not appear to remain an active condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the district court will verify the same bank guarantee and proceed with the process to release Lamichhane from custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Under the deal, viewers will be able to watch the 101st Academy Awards live on YouTube in 2029, with global rights secured through 2033.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This marks the first time in the Oscars\u2019 history, spanning more than 50 years of televised broadcasts, that live streaming rights have been awarded outside traditional television. Until now, the Oscars have been broadcast live on ABC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YouTube has confirmed that the Oscars ceremony will be available to stream free of charge. To make the event more accessible to a global audience, the platform will also provide captions and audio tracks in multiple languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the main ceremony, YouTube has secured streaming rights for other Academy events, including the Governors Awards and the Oscars Nominees Luncheon, both of which are typically held off-camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a joint statement, Academy CEO Bill Kramer and President Lynette Howell Taylor said the partnership with YouTube would allow the Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, to reach the widest possible global audience. They said the collaboration would expand engagement opportunities for the Oscars and other Academy events while honouring the institution\u2019s legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Announcing the move, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan described the Oscars as one of the world\u2019s essential cultural institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the new agreement, ABC, owned by The Walt Disney Company, will continue to broadcast the Oscars in 2026 and 2027, as well as the 100th anniversary ceremony in 2028. ABC has televised the Oscars annually since 1976. In recent years, viewership for the ceremony has declined as audiences increasingly shift to online streaming platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The result, announced midway through the party\u2019s 11th general convention, reflects both Oli\u2019s enduring influence and the internal power balance shaping UML\u2019s future course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Election Commission\u2019s latest figures, Oli secured 1,663 votes, defeating his closest challenger Ishwar Pokharel, who garnered 564 votes. While the formal announcement of the final results is still pending, the margin has effectively confirmed Oli\u2019s hat-trick victory. He had previously been elected chair during the party\u2019s ninth and tenth general conventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oli\u2019s re-election comes at a critical juncture for the UML, which has faced repeated internal rifts, electoral setbacks, and shifting alliances in recent years. His supporters view the mandate as a vote of confidence in his leadership and political line, while critics see it as a consolidation of power that leaves limited space for internal debate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The voting results across key leadership positions further underline Oli\u2019s strong grip on the party structure. In the race for three vice-general secretary posts, Lekhraj Bhatta, Raghubir Mahaseth, and Yogesh Bhattarai emerged victorious. Bhatta secured 1,452 votes, Mahaseth 1,368, and Bhattarai 1,348.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the three, Bhatta and Mahaseth were part of Oli\u2019s official panel, while Bhattarai contested from Pokharel\u2019s panel. Bhattarai\u2019s victory indicates that while Oli\u2019s faction dominates, the opposing camp has managed to retain a foothold within the upper leadership. Other contenders, including Bishnu Prasad Rimal, Anand Prasad Pokharel, Baijnath Chaudhary, and Rajendra Prasad Gautam, trailed significantly behind in the vote count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outcome of the secretary-level elections further reinforced Oli\u2019s position. All nine secretary posts were won by candidates aligned with the Oli panel, leaving little room for rival factions at this crucial organisational tier. Mahesh Basnet emerged as the top vote-getter with 1,544 votes, followed closely by Padma Kumari Aryal with 1,530 votes and Chhabilal Bishwakarma with 1,506 votes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other elected secretaries include Sherdhan Rai, Hikmat Kumar Karki, Khagaraj Adhikari, Yamlal Kandel, Rajan Bhattarai, and Bhanubhakta Dhakal. Their victories collectively signal a near-complete sweep by Oli loyalists, ensuring that the party\u2019s day-to-day organisational machinery remains firmly under his influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Political observers note that such a decisive outcome strengthens Oli\u2019s hand in shaping the UML\u2019s ideological direction, electoral strategy, and stance toward potential alliances. With trusted figures occupying key posts, Oli is expected to face fewer internal challenges in implementing his agenda in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the results also raise questions about internal democracy and inclusiveness within the party. Ishwar Pokharel\u2019s defeat, despite his long-standing role in UML leadership, highlights the shrinking space for alternative voices at the top. While pockets of resistance remain, as seen in Yogesh Bhattarai\u2019s victory, the overall picture suggests a leadership structure heavily tilted toward one faction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the general convention continues, attention will now turn to Oli\u2019s policy priorities and organisational reforms. Whether this renewed mandate translates into greater party unity and electoral revival, or deepens existing internal fault lines, will be closely watched in Nepal\u2019s evolving political landscape.</p>\n",

The hunting reserve has provided relief compensation to the affected farmers in Baglung, Myagdi, and Parbat districts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farmers have been suffering losses due to the killing of their domesticated cattle, including horses, mules, sheep, goats and cows by wild animals from the reserve. The hunting reserve provided relief to farmers worth Rs 2.492 million in the fiscal year 2079/80, Rs 1.2 million in 2080/81 and Rs 1.70 million in 2081/082, shared Sagar Subedi, ranger of Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Farmers have been raising a large number of livestock in the vicinity of the hunting reserve area. Every year, farmers have to bear the losses caused by wild animals attacking, injuring, and killing them, so the hunting reserve has been providing some relief,\u201d Ranger Subedi said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wild animals from the reserve have also been damaging crops planted in the fields adjacent to the reserve. However, the hunting reserve has not been providing relief compensation so far to farmers for crop damage. Every year, wild animals from the reserve destroy crops including potatoes and beans, said Tam Bahadur Sunar, a local of Dhorpatan Municipality-9. He said that wild animals including wild boars and monkeys feed on and damage various crops while leopards and other animals pounce on sheep and goats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Those who prefer to work within the country will be provided with skills-based training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security is preparing to offer vocational and skills development training to help the injured and families of the deceased secure domestic employment. The training will be provided through the Vocational and Skill Development Training Academy. For those seeking foreign employment, arrangements will be made to send them abroad free of cost in coordination with manpower agencies, the ministry said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Genz-Ghaite-Dharna-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577042\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ministry spokesperson Pitambar Ghimire said skills-based training required for domestic employment will be provided to families of the injured and deceased, adding that preparatory work is already underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newly appointed Labour Minister Rajendra Singh Bhandari has directed officials to proceed with providing skills training to link them with domestic employment, and also to ensure free arrangements for those wishing to go abroad. In line with the minister\u2019s directive, the ministry has begun necessary groundwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minister Bhandari has also held discussions with office-bearers of the Nepal Association of Foreign Employment Agencies, including its president Bhuwan Gurung, requesting coordination to send eligible individuals abroad free of charge. The association expressed its commitment to support the initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ministry is set to establish a Gen Z Employment Facilitation Mechanism, which, according to spokesperson Ghimire, will ensure dignified and safe domestic and foreign employment opportunities for families of the injured and deceased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Gen Z movement, around 2,500 people were injured and 76 lost their lives. The government has recognised the movement as a people\u2019s movement, and a 10-point agreement was reached between the government and Gen Z representatives. The agreement includes provisions for interim relief, compensation, free medical treatment and psychosocial counselling, free education, employment, social security, and meaningful memorialization for the families of martyrs and the injured, through consultation and coordination with those concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Approved through a ministerial-level decision on Mangsir 28, the plan states that climbing permits will no longer be issued without limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the action plan, legal and policy arrangements will be made to fix climber numbers and timing by considering a mountain\u2019s capacity, the short window of favourable weather for climbing, and the possibility of overcrowding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Complaints have been raised that excessive permits, including on Mount Everest, have caused management problems. To reduce such risks, the government has introduced a new action plan (2082/86) that includes stricter waste management, changes to the deposit system, greater use of technology, priority to human resource development, and tougher measures on waste disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercial mountaineering began after New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepal\u2019s Tenzing Norgay Sherpa successfully summited Everest on May 29, 1953. Since then, the number of climbers on Everest and other high Himalayan regions has steadily increased, leading to a rise in both biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, the ministry noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal is home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 mountains higher than 8,000 meters and has 28 mountain ranges, which are the source of more than 6,000 rivers and streams. There are 5,358 lakes and 2,232 glacial lakes across the country, while 1,310 peaks above 6,000 meters lie within Nepal. However, with the growing number of climbers, challenges related to the local environment, biodiversity, pollution, and waste generation have intensified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ministry warned that improper management of human waste, dead bodies, cans, bottles, plastic, tents, pouches, and bags used by climbers and trekkers could severely harm the Himalayan environment, making a new action plan necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the ministry, if temperatures continue to rise at the current rate, there is a risk that 36 per cent of snow could melt within this century, rising to 64 per cent if carbon emissions remain unchanged. Veteran climbers report that old waste is resurfacing at higher camps on Everest due to melting ice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the five-year plan, climbers will receive mandatory orientation on mountain cleanliness during pre-expedition briefings, and team leaders, members, agencies, and liaison officers will be required to provide written commitments. Equipment used to fix routes to the summit must be brought back after expeditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Everest, a temporary waste collection centre will be established at Camp 2, and climbers will be required to return a minimum specified amount of waste. The plan also includes converting the existing waste deposit into a mountain cleanliness fee, allocating separate budgets for mountain cleaning at all levels of government, annual cleanup campaigns for old waste and human remains, feasibility studies on using ropeways and drones for waste collection, GPS tracking to identify the location of bodies, and the formation of trained ranger teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government also plans to seek long-term funding for mountain conservation, including access to international climate finance and loss-and-damage funds through climate diplomacy. A feasibility study on relocating the Everest Base Camp has also been made public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

While the appointment of Sushila Karki as the country\u2019s first female prime minister has drawn global attention, another appointment within Nepal has received far less discussion despite its significance. <a href=\"https://www.durbarhighschool.edu.np/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.durbarhighschool.edu.np/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Durbar High School</a>, also known as Bhanu Secondary School, the first school in Nepal, has appointed its first female principal, 172 years after its establishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On November 20, Sharda Kumari Paudel was appointed principal of Durbar High School. Previously, she had been serving as the school\u2019s acting principal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breaking historical barriers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC03827.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577015\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being promoted from acting principal to principal, Paudel says she now feels more confident, responsible, and challenged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was appointed through an open competition among three contenders, in which she was the only female candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Established in 1854, Durbar High School took a long time to appoint a female principal. In this context, Paudel notes that in the past, women rarely entered the teaching profession, and those who did were mostly limited to teaching at the primary level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWomen in the past were confined to family life due to societal structures, which limited the time they could devote to their professional development,\u201d says Paudel. \u201cAs a result, it took a long time for women in almost every sector to reach higher positions, and Durbar High School is no exception.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Paudel considers herself fortunate, as it was her father who inspired her to become a teacher and pursue a career in the profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy father always motivated me to serve society, and as a result, I chose to become a teacher,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in Syangja in western Nepal, Paudel joined the teaching profession in 2004. Her first posting was at Mahendra Rastriya Secondary School in Baluwatar, where she taught health education for 10 years. In 2014, she joined Durbar High School as a permanent secondary-level teacher, teaching economics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, she was appointed assistant principal of the school. At that time, Durbar High School had only 71 students. In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she was appointed principal with limited responsibilities. Under her leadership, the school began conducting virtual classes. Despite the challenges, the school also focused on strengthening extracurricular activities. It organised a national essay competition on the impact of COVID-19 and established a robotics lab.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Public school revival</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC03819.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577016\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Durbar High School became the first government school in Nepal to introduce robotics classes. Students from the robotics program went on to win several competitions and participate in international events outside Nepal. Meanwhile, the school, severely damaged by the devastating 2015 earthquake, completed its renovation. In collaboration with Kathmandu Metropolitan City, smart boards were also installed in classrooms. After physical classes resumed, the number of students increased to 350.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the quality of education improved, Durbar High School began attracting public attention. Even parents who had been sending their children to private schools started enrolling them at Durbar High School, one of the rarest shifts seen in Nepal\u2019s education sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, under Paudel\u2019s leadership, the school\u2019s canteen and security systems improved. Currently, the school has 1,095 students. Managing such a large number of students has become one of Paudel\u2019s major challenges as principal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is compounded by the fact that Sanskrit Secondary School, which has around 900 students, is also operating within the Durbar High School building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs two different institutions run in the same building, conflicts sometimes arise among students and teachers, and in such cases I have to be especially sensitive,\u201d says Paudel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to overcrowding, the school is compelled to run tiffin breaks multiple times, which often causes disturbances. Efforts are underway to address this challenge, she adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classrooms of tomorrow</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC03882.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-577017\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the number of students continues to grow each year, the school\u2019s resources remain limited. However, with support from guardians, the school has managed to recruit additional staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent a shortage of teachers, the school has recently introduced the concept of a \u201cTeachers Bank.\u201d The Teachers Bank serves as a backup pool of teachers. For instance, if a teacher is unable to attend classes for a week or longer, the school can reach out to teachers listed in the Teachers Bank. The school has also publicly advertised this initiative and invited interested individuals to join. As a result, Paudel has received many inquiries and has been personally handling the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paudel\u2019s tenure as principal will be four years. Speaking to <a href=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"english.onlinekhabar.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Onlinekhabar</a>, she shared the plans she hopes to accomplish during her term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her priority is to strengthen the school\u2019s technological capacity so that students become more technologically skilled. Second, she plans to introduce more optional subjects. She also aims to prioritise sports. Lastly, she intends to improve students\u2019 public speaking skills and further enhance the quality of the robotics program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy goal is to make Durbar High School a place where students are confident, skilled, and ready to compete anywhere, not just in exams, but in life,\u201d says Paudel.<br></p>\n",

This movement resembled a spontaneous chemical reaction that spun out of control, producing outcomes that were difficult to separate and refine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It shattered the stereotype that this generation belongs only to the digital world. They proved they can also occupy the streets when necessary. Generation Z was the catalyst, but not the entire reaction. Because of the state\u2019s brutality, on September 9, not just the youth but citizens from every demographic came to the streets. It was this demographic inclusivity, this nationwide solidarity, that ultimately pressured the government from all directions and forced its resignation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state had responded with repression, intimidation, infiltration, and excessive force. Innocent youths and students were killed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The illusion of victory</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"850\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gen-z-protest-iconic-shoes-22.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-575783\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photos: Dinesh Gautam/Onlinekhbar</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the morale of Generation Z became so boosted that it shifted into an illusion. Instead of seeing themselves as one part of a national front, many began to act as though the victory belonged to them personally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This illusion encouraged factional divisions, the rise of \u201cme, myself, and I\u201d activism, and the formation of separate alliances and Gen Z clusters. The bigger mistake was failing to truly understand that this was a national movement, not just a generational one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Taking responsibility for the movement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second issue lies in the responsibility after the protest. Many who now sit in safe rooms, forming alliances and speaking as representatives, were not the ones who suffered the beatings, arrests, or loss. This selective ownership, the &#8220;we succeeded&#8221; but &#8220;they caused the damage&#8221; attitude, is not leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True responsibility includes accepting both the achievements and the mistakes. True representation includes those who were wounded, jailed, or lost their lives. The movement cannot be claimed as a personal badge of honour by a few elites, opportunists, influencer-activists, and populists who only appeared after the cost was already paid by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generation Z was compromised from the beginning. The protest began primarily as a reaction to the social media ban, not with a clear structural movement and unified demands. Agendas multiplied, from arrests of top officials to system reform to the push for a directly elected prime minister. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exposed the lack of a common purpose. The interim government emerged not as an imposition but as a compromise accepted by everyone at the time. If Gen Z had truly held a singular vision or a united demand, they would not have agreed to this arrangement in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A government for all citizens</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, dissatisfaction has surfaced, but frustration alone is not justification. You cannot say \u201cthis is not our government\u201d when you yourself accepted it at the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This government does not belong only to Generation Z, and it never did. It belongs to all citizens. The feeling of lost ownership stems from ego, not principle. If it truly belonged only to Gen Z, they would be leading it today, not Sushila Karki. She stepped in because the nation needed stability, not because Gen Z was denied something owed exclusively to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generation Z became vulnerable to negative labels like &#8220;berojaar,&#8221; &#8220;gajedi,&#8221; &#8220;lucifer,&#8221; &#8220;vitti,&#8221; &#8220;dropouts,&#8221; and &#8220;terrorists.&#8221; They broke the stereotype of apathy but failed to defend their identity afterwards. Some leaders became contaminated catalysts, focusing on self-recognition rather than real change. They turned elitist, populist, opportunistic, and influencer-driven. This shift made them vulnerable to the narrative that the movement was planned from the start, undermining its true purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The core issue: Structural and leadership compromise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The core issue lies in the structure of the movement. Many Generation Z leaders, frustrated by their government, are now susceptible to the idea of elections. Some see politics as a career extracted from Instagram and TikTok, driven by personal recognition rather than public service. They crave attention, but many of them aren\u2019t even known by their own neighbours. Meanwhile, competent individuals remain silent, afraid of being attacked by damaging narratives. Their disconnect from real political work undermines the movement\u2019s integrity and its future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still time to correct the course. Until recently, Generation Z had a strong public image, but it is now weakening not because of elders or politicians, but because of our own instability, division, and ego. Nepal is not made of one generation; it is a country of all generations. We need activism that is rooted in community reality instead of identity labels. And importantly, we must accept a basic truth: Gen Z triggered the collapse of the government, but did not architect its replacement. We owned the protest, but not the political apparatus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why those who now treat politics like a personal spotlight risk becoming performers instead of public servants. Leadership is not earned through social media visibility or street theatrics. It is built through consistency, durability, and institutional engagement. If we want to influence national direction, we must move from reaction to construction, from protest energy to policy discipline, and from impulse to accountability. The ballot remains the real instrument of political change, not the hashtag, not the microphone, not the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Previously, the record for the most expensive foreign player was held by fellow Australian Mitchell Starc, whom Kolkata bought for INR 24.75 crore at the auction for the 2024 IPL season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite being contracted for INR 25.20 crore, Green will not receive the full amount. Under new IPL regulations, a maximum salary cap has been set for overseas players. According to the rule, the maximum amount a foreign player can receive is equal to the highest retention price from the previous mega auction, which currently stands at INR 18 crore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a team bids more than this limit at the auction, the excess amount will not be paid to the player. Instead, the additional sum will be transferred by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to a player welfare fund. As a result, Green will receive no more than INR 18 crore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule aims to prevent excessive price inflation for overseas star players in mini auctions. The regulation does not affect Indian players, for whom no such salary cap has been imposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the most expensive player in IPL history overall is India\u2019s Rishabh Pant, who was signed by the Lucknow Super Giants for INR 27 crore at the auction for the previous season.</p>\n",

The official launch of the exercise is scheduled to take place today at Kasara, the headquarters of Chitwan National Park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The campaign, named the Fifth National Tiger Census, will be conducted using scientific methods and its results are expected to be released in March. The census area has been divided into three complexes: Chitwan\u2013Parsa, Banke\u2013Bardiya and Shuklaphanta\u2013Laljhadi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 2,300 automatic camera traps will be used in the census, with an estimated budget of Rs 25 million. According to Chitwan National Park Information Officer Avinash Thapa Magar, participants will be trained at Kasara on Poush 1 and 2, while trained personnel will be deployed to the field from Poush 3, said park chief Dr Ganesh Pant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camera traps will be installed across around 8,400 square kilometres of tiger habitats. Each two-by-two square kilometre area will be treated as a grid, with a pair of cameras placed to ensure full coverage. More than 250 personnel will be mobilised for the census.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation is leading the effort with financial and technical support from organisations including the National Trust for Nature Conservation, WWF and ZSL. The results are planned to be made public on World Tiger Day on July 29, 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous censuses recorded 121 tigers in 2009, 198 in 2013, 235 in 2018 and 355 in 2022, showing a steady rise in the tiger population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

As chair of the Wildlife Victim Fund and a former leader of community anti-poaching units, she has worked closely with local communities, Chitwan National Park authorities and conservation institutions, including the National Trust for Nature Conservation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her achievement is considered historic, particularly as the award competition is often dominated by conservationists from much larger countries. Paudel\u2019s work has also received international exposure through the PBS documentary series <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjRiuRqTgtQ&amp;t=270s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>In Her Nature</em>. </a>Earlier this year, she was honoured with the 2025 Conservation Award by WWF Nepal and the Bob &amp; Yang Xavier Academy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under her leadership, NDET has fully transitioned to animal-friendly tourism, avoiding activities harmful to wildlife and promoting sustainable and slow travel practices. The recognition comes at a time when Chitwan National Park has reported more than 750 days without a poaching incident, highlighting Nepal\u2019s growing success in conservation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1070\" height=\"1362\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Afbeelding-van-WhatsApp-op-2025-12-12-om-23.06.07_75ce61c6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576986\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Afbeelding-van-WhatsApp-op-2025-12-12-om-22.40.47_4f659479.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576987\"/></figure>\n",

Those heritages have been returned following international law, Subedi added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artefacts such as wood carvings, stone carvings, architecture, and statues, among others, that were created in Nepal and smuggled or stolen abroad are claimed and returned when found abroad, based on the information and with supporting evidence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the returned artefacts, especially the idols of gods and goddesses, have been religiously reinstated in their original locations.

According to Dr Bijaya Subba, Chairman of the UML Central Election Commission, voting will take place this afternoon. It is said that electronic voting machines will conduct the voting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 80 electronic voting machines have been arranged for voting purposes. Managing Director of Ram Laxman Innovation Pvt. Ltd, Laxman Rimal, said that the entry of the candidates&#8217; name list is ongoing at the company. &#8220;We are making efforts to complete our part in time and hand over to the UML Central Election Commission,&#8221; Rimal shared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also hinted at some delay in the voting time since it is time-consuming to enter the names of the candidates, given the large number of candidates. Aspirant candidates on Monday registered their nominations for the post of office-bearers and central committee members and the final name list of the voters was released on Monday itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UML&#8217;s 11th National Congress will elect a 301-member new central committee. As per the schedule, the voting will be held at Bhrikutimandap in Kathmandu this afternoon. Chairperson KP Sharma Oli and Senior Vice-Chairperson Ishwar Pokharel are vying for the top post in the UML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The K\u2013HAMI project, under the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), is working to support returnees from Korea in becoming entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to providing the necessary support to become self-employed and establish enterprises, the project will also offer access to required loan facilities. The initiative aims to provide technical and financial assistance to returnees who wish to apply the skills they acquired in Korea to start entrepreneurial ventures in Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this end, business competitions have been organised among returnees. Outstanding participants in these competitions will receive cash prizes and loan support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, a business competition was held among 10 returnees from Korea at the Central Training Centre of the Agricultural Development Bank in Bode, Bhaktapur. According to the project, returnee entrepreneurs under the K\u2013HAMI project implement their business ideas in practice after completing a one-year entrepreneurship education programme jointly conducted in Korea and Nepal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten participants had reached the final stage after completing entrepreneurship education under the Returnee Innovator for Nepal (RIN) programme. RIN is a component of the K\u2013HAMI project, which is implemented by The Bridge International with support from KOICA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was attended by South Korean Ambassador to Nepal Park Tae-Young, KOICA Country Director Mooheon Kong, Under Secretary Janak Sharma from the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security, among others. Competitive and inclusive business pitching sessions and product or prototype exhibitions were held among the trained returnees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Growth Track category, Tara Thapa secured first place and received a cash prize of Rs 500,000. Ravi Lal Pant finished second, while Khem Bahadur Karki came third, receiving cash prizes of Rs 300,000 and Rs 200,000 respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, under the Start Track category, Jankalal Tamang secured first place and received a cash prize of Rs 300,000. Ishwar Banmala finished second and Phulmaya Tamang third, receiving Rs 200,000 and Rs 100,000 respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of six returnee entrepreneurs received cash prizes through their business pitches. Additionally, 20 participants who completed entrepreneurship capacity-building training in the Growth Track and Startup categories in Nepal were honoured with certificates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programme has been providing significant support to returnees from Korea. According to Hwang Jinsol, CEO of The Bridge International, the primary objective of the initiative is to empower returnees to transform from migrant workers into successful entrepreneurs and contribute to Nepal\u2019s economic development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KOICA is a government agency of South Korea that provides grant aid and technical assistance for international development. Since 2022, KOICA has been undertaking various initiatives to turn the entrepreneurial dreams of returnees from Korea into reality.</p>\n",

They may be small, but their contribution to the world is enormous. A single bee can visit hundreds of flowers in a day, helping plants reproduce through pollination. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This natural process plays a key role in producing food for both humans and animals. Bees also provide high-quality products such as honey, royal jelly, pollen, and other products including beeswax, propolis, and honeybee venom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to experts at the <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/home/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Food and Agriculture Organization (</a>FAO), one-third of the world\u2019s food production depends on bees. Crops such as fruits, vegetables, oilseeds, and nuts rely heavily on bee pollination for better yield and quality. Without bees, these foods would become scarce and expensive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farmers benefit greatly from bees, as proper pollination leads to higher crop production without additional costs, increasing farmers\u2019 income and supporting rural economies. In areas where bee populations are declining, farmers are already experiencing reduced harvests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond agriculture, bees support biodiversity by pollinating wild plants, helping maintain healthy forests and ecosystems that support birds, animals, and other insects. Environmental experts warn that the loss of bees could disrupt the entire food chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But bees are under threat</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-bees-in-the-comb.jpg\" alt=\"honey bees in the comb\" class=\"wp-image-529398\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-bees-in-the-comb.jpg 1000w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-bees-in-the-comb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/honey-bees-in-the-comb-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bees are under serious threat due to human activities. Bee populations and other pollinators have been declining globally in recent years as a result of habitat loss, intensive commercial farming practices, changing weather patterns, and the random and excessive use of agrochemicals and pesticides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Climate change disrupts flowering cycles, making it difficult for bees to find sufficient food, while deforestation and urban expansion reduce the natural habitats where they live and breed. Bees are also affected by diseases and parasites, including viruses and mites, which weaken or kill colonies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monoculture farming, where only one type of crop is grown over large areas, limits the diversity of food sources bees need to survive. Pesticides pose a particularly serious risk: bees may be killed instantly through direct contact while foraging, or they may carry contaminated pollen or nectar back to the hive, spreading toxins to the queen, brood, and nurse bees, ultimately leading to the collapse of the entire colony.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There is still hope</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many developed countries have partially banned some toxic insecticides to reduce the deadly threat they pose to bees. World leaders gathered in Kunming, China, at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15), where they were expected to finalise the post-2020 biodiversity framework, which calls, among other goals, for a reduction in pesticide use by at least two-thirds by 2030. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>World Bee Day, observed each year on May 20, raises awareness of the essential role bees and other pollinators play in keeping people and the planet healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we can do to protect bees</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-bees-day-_-ICIMOD-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"protecting bees on world bees day Photo Courtesy: ICIMOD\" class=\"wp-image-529391\" srcset=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-bees-day-_-ICIMOD-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-bees-day-_-ICIMOD-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-bees-day-_-ICIMOD-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-bees-day-_-ICIMOD-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-bees-day-_-ICIMOD-2.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To protect bees, we can take several practical and community-based actions. Planting nectar-bearing flowers such as marigolds and sunflowers helps provide essential food sources for bees. Supporting local beekeepers by buying honey and other hive products strengthens sustainable beekeeping practices and local livelihoods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raising awareness about the importance of bees in schools and colleges, while linking this knowledge with entrepreneurship, can inspire future generations to protect pollinators and develop eco-friendly businesses. The proper and responsible use of pesticides that do not harm vital pollinators like bees is also crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, encouraging local beekeepers and actively promoting their products helps create a supportive environment for bee conservation and sustainable agriculture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us join together to protect bees for the survival of humanity and the planet.</p>\n",

As part of the nighttime urban beautification campaign, 13,340 electric lights were installed in Kathmandu. In the last fiscal year, KMC carried out the infrastructural projects worth Rs 2.86 billion. The heritage conservation made up Rs 910 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the local level has retrieved 208 ropanis of public land worth Rs 23 billion. Locally available resources and skills are given priority for entrepreneurship promotion. Transfer of indigenous skills will be materialised through &#8216;one ward: one scheme&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regular work areas for KMC are the economic, social and administrative ones.

Rudrakali is seven years old, and Khagendra Prasad is six years old. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Haribhadra Acharya, the Information Officer of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, said that the two elephant calves are to be sent to Qatar on 17th December, via a chartered cargo plane from Bhairahawa International Airport. Acharya said that preparations are being made to send the elephants to Bhairahawa from Sauraha a day earlier, after coordinating with the plane&#8217;s flight schedule and assessing the road conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These elephants are going to be kept at Al Khor Park&#8217;s zoo in Doha, Qatar. According to Information Officer Acharya, two mahouts are also going to Qatar under the leadership of park animal technician Dinesh Dhakal, accompanying the calves. They will return home after ensuring the management of the elephant calves there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Nepal has been presenting various wild animals, such as the one-horned rhinoceros and elephants to different friendly nations as gifts. These wildlife gifts have been presented to strengthen the bilateral relations and to project the importance of Nepal&#8217;s biodiversity at the international level. Acharya said that this is the first time that Nepal is sending elephants as a present to another country. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The elephant breeding centre, established in 2044 BS with 16 elephants brought from India, two from Myanmar, and two from Thailand, has so far bred and raised 68 elephants. Six of those born here have died. It is said that 61 elephants have been trained here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, Nepal has gifted 26 rhinos, 10 tortoises, one wolf and two leopards to various countries since 1985. Nepal had expressed its commitment to gift elephants to Qatar during the official visit of then-President Bidya Devi Bhandari in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Following an order from the Patan High Court, the Department of Foreign Employment has removed the temporary restriction placed on the procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The department had issued a notice on Bhadra 31 stating that implementation of the procedure had been suspended. In response to a writ petition filed against the notice, the High Court ordered that the suspension should not be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the court order, the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security issued a circular on Kartik 24 directing that the Bhadra 31 notice should not be enforced. With the court\u2019s order, the procedure has now moved into the implementation phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ministry of Labour had introduced the procedure to send skilled workers to South Korea under the E-7 visa. The guidelines allow manpower companies to recruit and send skilled workers, and the Nepali Embassy in South Korea had also been instructed to resume demand letter verification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a complaint was later filed with the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) against the government\u2019s decision. The CIAA directed that the procedure should not be implemented, prompting the department to issue the suspension notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business operators subsequently approached the court against the department\u2019s notice. In response to the same writ petition, the High Court ordered that the notice should not be enforced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Department Director Tikaram Dhakal said the Bhadra 31 notice was withdrawn based on the court\u2019s order and the ministry\u2019s circular. However, both the ministry and the department appear uncertain about whether the pathway for sending workers has been fully reopened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, South Korea recruits foreign workers through two channels. Under the Employment Permit System (EPS), workers are hired from 17 countries worldwide. In addition, Korea also recruits skilled workers under the E-7 visa from EPS-participating countries. Nepal had developed the procedure to send workers under the E-7 visa, but the move had faced widespread criticism, with concerns raised that it could undermine the EPS system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

While most turn to medication for relief, doctors advise against taking medicine for mild symptoms unless necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common symptoms of cold and cough include a runny or stuffy nose, headache, body ache, difficulty breathing due to phlegm, and loss of appetite. These eight home remedies suggested by Ayurvedic physician Dr Amrit Bhandari also the director at Sahara Ayurveda and Therapy Center Pvt Ltd, Gongabu, Kathmandu can often be alleviated using simple home remedies readily available in most kitchens. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Turmeric water</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Turmeric is effective in combating allergies and viral infections due to its active compound, curcumin, which boosts immunity. Mix a teaspoon of turmeric powder in a glass of warm milk or water, let it sit for a while, and drink it like tea. Consume it twice daily, in the morning and evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Consume warm liquids</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking plenty of warm liquids, including water, soups, and protein-rich broths, helps alleviate cold symptoms. These improve immunity and support the body in fighting off infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Honey with warm water</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honey is a natural remedy with immune-boosting properties. Mixing honey with warm water can soothe cold symptoms and relieve cough. It is also commonly used in many homemade remedies for colds and coughs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Ginger</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginger\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties help reduce dry or asthmatic cough and provide pain relief. Mixing ginger juice with honey in warm water or milk can soothe the throat and alleviate cough.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Basil leaves</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Boil four to five basil leaves in tea or warm water for two minutes, and consume the mixture two to three times daily. Adding honey or salt enhances its effectiveness. Alternatively, chewing fresh basil leaves can relieve throat irritation and coughing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Cloves and cinnamon</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloves and cinnamon have antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties. Boil them in water or milk, optionally adding ginger and turmeric for flavor, to reduce throat irritation and cough.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Black pepper</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black pepper is considered a traditional remedy for colds. Add ground pepper to warm water or milk and drink it. Black pepper contains compounds like piperine, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc, chromium, and vitamins A, C, and D, which provide various health benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8.

For a runny nose without congestion, steam inhalation may not be necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If symptoms persist for an extended period, or if you develop a high fever that does not subside, consult a doctor immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Originally published on December 23, 2024.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The program gathered 27 young leaders from across Nepal working in civic engagement, social justice, education, and grassroots organising. Initiatives of Change USA is part of a global movement that links personal change with social transformation, supporting individuals and communities committed to ethical leadership, dialogue, and responsibility in public life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a hybrid format of two online sessions and eight in-person workshops, the program offered young leaders time and space to reflect on values, power, ethics, and responsibility, especially for those who work without consistent access to mentorship or reflective leadership spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program focused on lived experience rather than theory. Participants developed narratives to communicate their work with clarity and care, explored conflict and dialogue as part of everyday leadership, and examined ethical dilemmas drawn from their own realities. Each participant designed a community-based initiative shaped by the questions and commitments they will carry back to their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key moment of the program was the graduation panel discussion held on Sunday, titled \u201cChange Makers &#8211; Gen Z in Action: Stories, strategies, and ethics for the next generation of political leaders.\u201d The panel explored how young people in Nepal are engaging politics through grassroots movements, digital platforms, and storytelling, while navigating structural limits and ethical pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the discussion, Ojaswee Bhattarai, Chairperson of the Progressive Democratic Party, spoke about the gap between youth visibility and real decision-making power, calling for deeper reforms within political parties and institutions. Shree Gurung, academic and independent political leader, reflected on long-term political engagement, drawing from his work during Nepal\u2019s constitutional period and his 2022 federal election run, and emphasized patience, principle, and economic self-reliance. Rijan Ranamagar, founder of GenZ Rebels, shared insights from people-led movements that have compelled state response, highlighting the tension between urgency and ethics in grassroots activism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants also reflected on their experience. Ritika Rana, a lawyer and participant, shared that the program helped her name choices she had been carrying quietly in her work. \u201cLSJP gave me language for decisions I was already making,\u201d she said. \u201cIt made me think more carefully about who I am becoming through this work.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the program, participants showed stronger confidence in their leadership practice, deeper ethical awareness, and improved skills in dialogue, collaboration, and conflict navigation. The final community initiatives reflected diverse priorities, including civic education, gender justice, peacebuilding, and youth participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The graduation panel was moderated by Vinode Deuba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program was facilitated by practitioners and leaders from across policy, academia, media, and organizational leadership, including Devika Thapa (World Bank), Meena Sharma (Dignified Workplace), Preeti Thapa (The Asia Foundation), Dr. Pitambar Bhandari (Tribhuvan University), Serena Rix (Media and Policy Advisor), Manushi Yami Bhattarai (Professor of Political Science), Anjani Gandi (Bento Coach), and Kamal Kandel (Initiatives of Change Nepal).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nepal Edition was implemented in a collaboration with Project Abhaya, a youth-led initiative working across Nepal to expand civic literacy, political education, and leadership pathways for young women and marginalized youth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on the program, Ishika Panta, Program Lead, said, \u201cMany young people in Nepal are already carrying leadership without recognition or power. This program was about helping them name that responsibility and carry it with integrity.\u201d</p>\n",

The general convention was formally inaugurated yesterday at Sallahghari in Bhaktapur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the statute convention was already concluded in Bhadra, the UML has directly entered the leadership selection process from today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incumbent party chair KP Sharma Oli and Ishwar Pokhrel are the main contenders for the leadership. The party has stated that it will attempt to select the leadership through consensus, but if consensus is not reached, the selection will be conducted through a voting process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UML has announced that electronic voting machines will be used for the election. The party has also amended its statute at the last minute to increase the number of office bearers and Central Committee members.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uml-bandasatra-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576935\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uml-bandasatra-19.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576936\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uml-bandasatra-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576938\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uml-bandasatra-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576939\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uml-bandasatra-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576941\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"830\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uml-bandasatra-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576942\"/></figure>\n",

Photo: Association Moey</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the years, I have had the privilege of spending time with various animals. The three leopards cramped in our zoo; Rangila, the rescued dancing bear; snakes that were defanged and exhibited during Shivaratri; tigers imprisoned in Sauraha; the dog who saved my life on a cold December day; the old crow who died next to my tree; the calf who died on my lap; caterpillars in my backyard; and countless others with stories of their own, trying very hard to survive and share this planet with humans, with us. However, no one comes closer when connections are built, when moments are shared, when the sheer presence of these animals challenges your own existence, than the mighty elephants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have spent silences and sounds with elephants, the wild and the captive, both holding secrets of humanity, or rather, lessons on how humans need to embody what they preach. After all, what are religion and spirituality but mirrors of how we act without expecting anything in return? And what can be more selfless than embodying the principle of non-violence? On the contrary, those who speak of religious philosophies often deviate from their sanctity and compromise them for comfort. Renowned as Lord Ganesha, elephants have adorned our altars, temples, jewellery, and tote bags since antiquity. Known as <em>Bignaharta</em>, elephants have been immortalised as stone idols, ornaments, water-resistant paintings, and gifts for our NRN relatives. Revered as symbols of Tantrism, elephants appear in music videos, paraded toward Boudha with prayer flags, mandalas, and man-made celebrations. Projected as tokens of tourism, elephants have been traded for diplomacy, broken for profit, bred for commerce, and eventually abandoned as expendable. Therefore, please excuse my tone when I say that religiously and spiritually, we have proven ourselves hypocritical and trite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of trite, one of the most overdone, over-explained, and endlessly justified spectacles is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.junglesafariresort.com/elephant-festival.php\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.junglesafariresort.com/elephant-festival.php\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elephant Festival</a>,\u201d organised each year under a welfare-washed model. This year, too, it is all set to awe audiences while abused and overworked elephants are forced to participate in a human circus. The elephants are adorned with paint and art; they move, run, and dance while mahouts remind them of the cost of rebellion, the hook and the stick. Every year, without fail, the United Elephant Owners\u2019 Association offers unapologetic justifications through press conferences, claiming how much they love their elephants, how they have paid crores for them, and therefore how no one, least of all animal rights activists, can love these elephants more than they do. They reduce elephants to commodities they have purchased, like expensive watches worn once and then locked away in boxes, except elephants are not inanimate objects. They are among the most intelligent and sentient animals known, with complex emotions and personalities. They form bonds, develop relationships, curate experiences, and actively shape forests and ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d worldview argues that elephants have always been abused for centuries and continue to be abused today, so why raise objections now? The answer lies in the moment an elephant is born. The practice of <em>Phajaan</em> is also business as usual. <em>Phajaan</em> literally translates to \u201cbreaking the spirit\u201d and refers to the brutal process through which a young calf is \u201ctrained\u201d to submit to human control. The baby elephant is separated from its mother, beaten, starved, and scarred until the immense spirit within its small body finally breaks. This is how a \u201csubmissive\u201d elephant is created, while the mother cries and yearns for her child. This industry functions quite literally on the broken backs of elephants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, these elephants have been chained when not overworked, forced to walk long distances and carry heavy <em>howdahs</em>, and further exploited by entitled tourists, all without the freedom to explore, eat according to their biological needs, or receive the care they deserve. Visit any facility offering elephant rides, baths, or feeding, and you will see elephants chained, swaying their heads from side to side. Many mistake this for joy, assuming they are dancing, but this is a clear sign of psychological distress. And after all, when we choose selective ignorance, no sign truly matters, does it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kajol Kali, who collapsed and died a painful death because she could no longer work. Ramu, chained for countless years, was sold and resold until his spirit retaliated. Pawankali, a solitary elephant in our zoo, is nearly blind, old, forced, and beaten. Champakali, made to carry ammunition during the Maoist insurgency, was fully aware of the weight yet unaware of the intent. Chanchalkali, whose trunk was severed in retaliation by criminals who remain unpunished to this day. Countless others were maimed, abused, disconnected, emaciated, hungry, sick, abandoned, smuggled, and forgotten. For anyone with even a fragment of conscience, these accounts should be enough to abandon the ego-driven desire to participate in this cruel industry. But conscience often disappears when money, greed, and ego take centre stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why should we care about the largest land animals simply because they carry humans who weigh, in comparison, no more than butterflies? Eureka, that\u2019s precisely it. Elephants can feel even a butterfly landing on their backs. Their sensitive spines, with prominent ribs, are not built to carry heavy loads. Over time, this causes spinal arching, arthritis, and chronic pain. Why should we care when this is a \u201ctraditional\u201d practice meant to be preserved? Because traditions rooted in injustice and cruelty, like the Kamaiya system or slavery, must be dismantled. What will the owners do if their livelihoods depend on exploitation? They must find alternatives: sanctuary models, ethical tourism, and welfare-based systems. Solutions are plentiful if the intent is sincere. How will they afford to care for elephants? They must figure it out. These businesses profited from elephant exploitation; now they must take responsibility for those who form the identity of places like Sauraha, Bardiya, and Parsa. The entire industry, including the government-run <em>Hatisaar</em>, which openly displays chained elephants and the process of <em>Phajaan</em> on its walls, has benefited from abuse. Now it is time to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, this is not about what owners or industries will do. Such questions are never asked when addressing child trafficking or drug cartels. So why frame them when animals are involved? The real question is what you, as an audience, spectator, and market, can do. Refuse. Refuse elephant festivals, rides, baths, and wedding spectacles, even those promoted by the Nepal Tourism Board. This is a demand-driven industry: as long as consumers demand cruelty, it will be supplied. Seek ethical sanctuaries that care for rescued elephants; few exist, but they do. Demand reform, welfare standards, transparency, retirement for elephants, and accountability. It is time for humans to honour our side of the unspoken treaty between humans and animals, signed at the very conception of our species.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elephants are majestic beings. They live in families where matriarchs pass wisdom across generations. They have nannies, grandmothers, and aunts who nurture the young. They communicate through complex vocal codes and frequencies. They traverse vast distances for food and water, guided by ancestral memory. They anticipate droughts, understand their ecological roles as forest architects, and practise empathy and care. When encountering fallen nests, they step around them to protect fragile eggs. They mourn their dead and live rich lives, dispersing seeds and sustaining ecosystems as remarkable pollinators. Above all, they are sentient beings who feel, love, and connect just as deeply as we do. They do not deserve chains, punishment, starvation, or abuse under any justification. The next time you encounter an elephant subjected to <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-captive-elephant-ill-treatment.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-captive-elephant-ill-treatment.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">captivity</a>, cruelty, and apathy, look into their eyes, apologise, and say: \u201cNever again.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

He died while undergoing treatment for oral cancer at HAMS Hospital in Kathmandu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Nepali Congress leader and former Chief Minister of Koshi Province Kedar Karki, Upadhyay died on Saturday evening during treatment. A resident of Morang, he had been staying in Kathmandu in recent months for medical care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upadhyay was elected twice to the House of Representatives from the then Morang Constituency No. 1 (now No. 2). He also served as Minister for Education after winning the 2056 BS by-election.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2056 BS, Girija Prasad Koirala won elections from both Morang and Sunsari constituencies. After Koirala vacated Morang Constituency No. 1, a by-election was held in which Upadhyay emerged victorious. He also won the election to the first Constituent Assembly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Congress leader Yadu Bista, Upadhyay was the only Nepali Congress candidate to win from Morang in the 2064 BS first Constituent Assembly election. \u201cAfter winning the 2056 BS by-election, he went on to win the first Constituent Assembly election, but was defeated in the second Constituent Assembly election,\u201d Bista said. \u201cAfter the second Constituent Assembly election, his wife passed away, following which he gradually withdrew from active politics.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bista described Upadhyay as a modest and intellectual leader. \u201cHe believed that democracy can only be strengthened through direct dialogue with the people,\u201d Bista said, adding that Upadhyay was imprisoned several times during political movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known for his simple lifestyle, Upadhyay was popular among party cadres during his active political career. Journalist Kumod Adhikari, who was close to him, said Upadhyay never forgot people he had met and always addressed them by name. \u201cHis lifestyle was very simple,\u201d Adhikari said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A resident of Aamgachhi in Morang, Upadhyay was also a trusted confidant of Girija Prasad Koirala. He held a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from India and is survived by two sons and a daughter.</p>\n",

With the victory, Lumbini have been crowned new NPL champions, while Sudurpaschim Royals finished runners-up for the second consecutive time. After captain Rohit Paudel, Sher Malla, and Ruben Trumpelmann shone with the ball, Lumbini bowled Sudurpaschim out for just 85 runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chasing a modest target of 86 runs in the final, Lumbini completed the chase in just nine overs, losing four wickets to clinch the championship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On their way to the title, Lumbini registered six consecutive wins in their last six matches. After defeating Chitwan Rhinos in their opening game, Lumbini suffered three straight losses and were at one point in danger of being eliminated in the league stage. However, they staged a remarkable comeback and went on to lift the NPL trophy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumbini opener Dinesh Adhikari set the tone early by smashing four sixes in the very first over bowled by Sudurpaschim captain Dipendra Singh Airee, helping Lumbini race to 27 runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adhikari played a blistering knock, scoring 42 runs off just 13 balls, hitting one four and five sixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first wicket, Adhikari and D\u2019Arcy Short added 58 runs in four overs. The partnership was broken in the fifth over by Hemant Dhami, who dismissed both batters. Short was bowled for 13 runs off 14 balls on the first ball of the over, while Adhikari was caught by Scott Kuggeleijn on the third ball of the same over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain Rohit Paudel contributed 16 runs off 12 balls, hitting two fours and one six. Niroshan Dickwella remained unbeaten on 11 runs off 12 balls, while Dilip Nath scored the winning run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defending runners-up Sudurpaschim Royals, who won the toss and opted to bat first, were bowled out for 85 runs in 19.1 overs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudurpaschim\u2019s total of 85 is jointly the fourth-lowest score in NPL history and the lowest total ever in an NPL final.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudurpaschim\u2019s innings collapsed under sharp bowling from Lumbini captain Rohit Paudel, Sher Malla, and Ruben Trumpelmann.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening batter Ishan Pandey top-scored for Sudurpaschim with 33 runs, anchoring the innings as wickets fell at the other end. He faced 51 balls and hit one four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pandey and captain Dipendra Singh Airee added 25 runs for the fourth wicket. Airee scored 13 runs off 20 balls, hitting one six. Hermit Singh and Scott Kuggeleijn chipped in with 10 runs each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Lumbini, Ruben Trumpelmann, Rohit Paudel, and Sher Malla each claimed three wickets. Rohit completed a hat-trick in the 11th over, dismissing Dipendra Singh Airee, Dipak Bohara, and Punit Mehra in successive deliveries. He conceded just 12 runs in his four-over spell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trumpelmann took 3 wickets for just 3 runs in 2.1 overs, while Sher Malla claimed 3 wickets for 18 runs in four overs. Tilak Bhandari picked up one wicket for 26 runs in four overs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Writing a long Facebook status titled <em>Bakapatra</em> (Open Letter) on Friday morning, he attempted to refute media reports claiming that he escaped to the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stating that he had obtained an \u201cExtraordinary Ability Green Card\u201d two years ago, Dhurmus said he is currently in the United States solely for his daughter\u2019s leg treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He writes, \u201cAfter we could no longer continue our artistic career in Nepal and found no foundation to sustain our lives, we applied for the USA&#8217;s \u2018Extraordinary Ability Green Card\u2019 three years ago from Nepal out of sheer compulsion. This is a permanent residency permit granted to individuals with exceptional abilities in various fields.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAfter receiving this card, low-income parents\u2019 children can receive free treatment through insurance or Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier, our second child, who was in Kunjana\u2019s womb, was lost due to stress. We did not want to take any risks with our only surviving child. For her health and secure future, we decided to apply for this Extraordinary Ability category.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe received the visa last year, two years after applying. But on the day we got the visa, we could not celebrate; we broke down in tears. This was not a decision made out of desire. We were prisoners of circumstance. We came to the USA last year. To manage the travel expenses, Kunjana sold all the jewellery she had,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPutting aside all other problems so our daughter\u2019s life is not at risk, we were compelled to come to the US now. I hope everyone understands this compulsion,\u201d he added. \u201cWe did not run away. There is no doubt that we will return to Nepal after our daughter completes her treatment. After that, we want to immerse ourselves in our artistic work again.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that until they are freed from the complications surrounding the Gautam Buddha International Cricket Stadium (Rangashala) project, they have been unable to work or live peacefully in Nepal. \u201cOur only wish is that the Rangashala issue gets resolved so we can live and work in Nepal as artists.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He claimed they have neither started a business in the US nor made any investments. He urged the government to resolve the Rangashala dispute and create an environment for them to return to their artistic profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also shared a photograph taken at the airport with his wife, actress Kunjana Ghimire \u2018Suntali\u2019, and their daughter. He said that due to continuous government hassles and financial liabilities exceeding Rs 180 million, they were ultimately forced to travel to the US for their daughter\u2019s treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wrote that the Rangashala construction had begun at the request of the public and with encouragement from then and former prime ministers and various leaders. The Bharatpur Metropolitan City had taken the lead by providing the land, and as per the agreement with the metropolis, both sides would share responsibility if resources could not be raised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He described the situation, where the state can inherit assets but refuses to accept liabilities as \u201cironic.\u201d Despite receiving a \u201cclean chit\u201d from the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), he expressed sadness that he was still labelled a \u201cfraud.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that although Bharatpur Metropolitan City had committed to settling the liabilities within a month after ownership transfer, this had not been fulfilled. He also said that grants repeatedly promised by the Cabinet and budget allocations had been frozen and returned due to procedural errors and bureaucratic negligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to sources, Dhurmus and Suntali are currently staying at the home of a relative in North Carolina, USA. Professionally, his film <em>Laaj Sharanam</em> was released earlier this year, and he is working on the upcoming movie <em>Paanch Pandav</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The event brought together artists, scholars and cultural leaders to reflect on Joshi\u2019s intellectual contributions and lasting influence on Nepal\u2019s visual art traditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programme was chaired by Sanjay Bantawa, Head of NAFA\u2019s Contemporary Painting Department, with Chancellor Naradmani Hartamchhali as the chief guest. Art scholars Pranab Man Singh and Deepmala Maharjan presented papers examining Joshi\u2019s artistic legacy, while artist Mukesh Malla provided critical commentary on their insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at the ceremony, Chancellor Hartamchhali said the programme underscored Joshi\u2019s deep intellectual engagement and academic grounding. He noted that Joshi\u2019s ability to adapt the artistic grammar he learned in India into a distinctly Nepali visual language reflects the depth of his artistic intellect. Emphasising that culture and art stand as civilisational assets, he said Joshi\u2019s comprehensive body of work must be studied to guide younger generations in the complex discipline of fine arts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NAFA Member Secretary Devendra Kumar Kafle \u2018Thumkeli\u2019 said Joshi was not only an artist but also an art activist and a multidimensional figure who envisioned institutional development for Nepal\u2019s fine arts sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Department Head Bantawa highlighted Joshi as an innovator capable of merging modern styles with symbolic and spiritual elements. He stressed the need to research and archive Joshi\u2019s diverse artistic themes for future study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Academician Rameshnath Khanal, Academician Ratankumar Rai and Dibesh Man Singh Pradhan also expressed their views on the presentations and discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event saw the participation of NAFA council members, academicians, artists, writers and journalists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Snow leopards, following their prey, also approach settlements and cause damage to local herders\u2019 livestock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> In recent times, establishing coexistence between humans and snow leopards has become tricky due to climate change.

The Royals had already reached their second consecutive final after defeating Biratnagar in the first qualifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chasing a target of 135 runs set by Lumbini, Biratnagar were bowled out for 94 runs in 17.5 overs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Biratnagar, Sam Hain scored 34 runs off 28 balls, hitting 2 fours and 2 sixes. Naren Bhatt scored 21, and Merchant de Lange contributed 17 runs. The remaining players failed to reach double digits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumbini\u2019s Ruben Trumpelmann and Sher Malla delivered an impressive spell in the powerplay, taking early wickets and shaking Biratnagar\u2019s innings from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 6\u20133 and then 30\u20134, Biratnagar were in trouble, but a 28-run partnership between Hain and de Lange offered brief resistance. Once the stand was broken, Biratnagar\u2019s batting collapsed completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Lumbini, Tilak Bhandari took 3 wickets for 15 runs in 4 overs. Ruben Trumpelmann picked up 2 wickets for just 9 runs in 3 overs. Abhisesh Gautam took 2 wickets for 22 runs in 4 overs. JJ Smit also took 2 wickets, while Sher Malla claimed 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, after losing the toss at the TU International Cricket Stadium in Kirtipur, Lumbini posted 134 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in the allotted 20 overs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Lumbini, opener D\u2019Arcy Short scored the highest with 45 runs. He faced 41 balls and hit 3 fours and 1 six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the team at 8 runs for 1 wicket, Dinesh Adhikari fell for just 1 run. Short and captain Rohit Paudel then built a 69-run partnership for the second wicket. Rohit scored 34 runs off 30 balls, hitting 2 fours and 2 sixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dinesh Adhikari, who opened for the second consecutive match, once again failed to impress. Wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella added 29 runs off 22 balls with 4 boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandip Jora and JJ Smit were dismissed for ducks, while Dilip Nath managed only 1 run. Sher Malla contributed 7 runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumbini were at 69/1 after the first 10 overs but struggled in the remaining half of the innings. In the last 10 overs, they added 65 runs but lost 7 wickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biratnagar bowlers, especially Subash Bhandari, captain Sandeep Lamichhane, and Pratish GC, bowled exceptionally well, taking regular wickets and putting pressure on Lumbini\u2019s innings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subash took 3 wickets for 16 runs in 4 overs. Pratish took 3 wickets for 25 runs in 4 overs, while captain Sandeep claimed 2 wickets for 18 runs in his 4 overs.</p>\n",

For the body to be truly healthy, there must be balance in the body, mind, and daily routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organization says, \u201cGood health is not merely the absence of disease; it is complete physical, mental, and social well-being.\u201d In Nepal, over the past 15 years, obesity has increased fourfold, diabetes sixfold, and heart disease threefold. The main reasons behind this are unhealthy eating habits, limited physical activity, and stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news, however, is that if ordinary Nepali lifestyle habits are followed scientifically, anyone can transform themselves to become strong, agile, and disease-free within 6 to 12 months. Here&#8217;s five things to pay attention to become strong and fit as suggested by Dr Narendra Lamichhane, who is an MD-certified acupuncture specialist serving at Gandaki Ayurveda Hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Balanced Diet</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nutrition is the foundation of fitness. It is said that we become what we eat. Around 70\u201380 per cent of good health depends on what\u2019s on the plate. This means eating 5 to 9 servings of fruits and vegetables every day. The more colourful your plate with natural foods, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A breakfast plate that includes red tomatoes, carrots, green spinach, broccoli, yellow lemon, corn, purple cabbage, and beetroot provides all the vitamins and minerals the body needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, muscles cannot grow without protein. A person weighing 60 kg needs 100 to 130 grams of protein per day. This can easily be achieved in a typical Nepali kitchen: mung beans, lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, eggs, small local fish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, soybeans, soymilk, cashews, almonds, and walnuts should be consumed adequately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbohydrates are also necessary but in the right form. Millet, buckwheat, barley, maize, sweet potatoes, and brown rice provide energy without spiking blood sugar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthy fats are essential for hormone production. Ghee, mustard oil, flaxseed, walnuts, fish oil, and coconut oil should be used regularly. Sugar, refined flour, instant noodles, cheese balls, chips, packaged juices, Coke, and Fanta should be eliminated as much as possible. Drink at least three to four litres of water daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking two glasses of warm water with lemon and honey on an empty stomach in the morning cleans the gut and boosts metabolism.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Physical Exercise</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The body does not become strong without exercise. One must do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 300 minutes of light exercise per week. The body needs three types of exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First</strong>, <em>cardio</em>, which strengthens the heart and reduces fat.<br>Fast walking, running, skipping rope, cycling, and swimming are good cardio options. Fast walking for 45 minutes daily can reduce 2 to 4 kg of fat in a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, <em>strength training</em>, which builds muscles.<br>Push-ups, squats, planks, and pull-ups can be done using your own body weight. In the gym, compound exercises like deadlifts, squats, bench press, and overhead press can be done. Doing this 3 to 5 days a week is enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, yoga and stretching are necessary for flexibility and balance.<br>Surya Namaskar, Vrikshasana, Tadasana, Bhujangasana, and Trikonasana help make joints flexible and prevent injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A routine of 45 minutes of fast walking, 12 rounds of Surya Namaskar, and 10 minutes of skipping rope for three months can reduce waist size, broaden shoulders, brighten the face, and boost confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Sleep</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep is the greatest medicine. Without 7 to 8 hours of deep sleep at night, hormones become imbalanced. During deep sleep, growth hormone, testosterone, and melatonin are released abundantly,  these help build muscles, burn fat, and strengthen immunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One should develop the habit of sleeping before 10 pm. Mobile phones, laptops, and TV should be turned off at least one hour before bed because blue light reduces melatonin levels by up to 50 per cent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking a glass of warm milk with turmeric and pepper before sleeping improves sleep quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Stress Management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress is the biggest enemy of muscle growth and the main reason fat accumulates around the stomach. When stress increases, the hormone cortisol rises, which stores fat around the waist and breaks down muscles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meditation, anulom-bilom, bhramari pranayama, or kapalbhati for 10\u201315 minutes daily reduces stress. Walking in nature, talking with friends, laughing, and pursuing hobbies improve mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Avoid Smoking and Alcohol</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoking and alcohol are the biggest enemies of health. It is best to quit them completely, or reduce them drastically if quitting is difficult. Also, using mobile phones late at night disturbs both sleep and hormones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people in Nepal are deficient in Vitamin D and B12. Sitting in the sun for 15\u201320 minutes produces Vitamin D. Eggs, fish, milk, and yogurt provide Vitamin B12. Annual blood tests should be done to check sugar, cholesterol, thyroid, and vitamin levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitness cannot be achieved by practicing these methods for just one day. Habits form in 21 days, changes appear in 90 days, and a completely new body forms in one year. Improving just one per cent every day results in a 70-fold improvement in a year. With consistency and patience, a strong, fit, and confident life is guaranteed.</p>\n",

Acting Mayor of Lumbini Sanskritik Municipality, Kalpana Harijan, and Nikesh Adhikari, chairperson of the organising body The Promise Land, jointly inaugurated the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acting Mayor Harijan said efforts would be made to introduce Buddhist education in the 10 community schools of the area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere are many municipalities in the world, but there is only one birthplace of the Buddha. Programs like this are important for global peace and prosperity,\u201d she said during the inaugural program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the first day, former Ethiopian Prime Minister Tamrat Layne engaged in a conversation with Sudhamshu Dahal on spiritual transformation, leadership, lessons on world peace, and community empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have come from different countries, but our common desire is peace,\u201d Tamrat said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LP Bhanu Sharma of the Jeevan Vigyan delivered a presentation on meditation, highlighting that Nepal has a 10,000-year-old spiritual history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, actor Rajesh Hamal and Susan Zhu, CEO of Treasure Carbon Group, delivered keynote speeches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamal said that although Nepalis often feel discouraged, they possess a great wealth, the ability to smile when they speak.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe conflicts in my films last only for a few moments, but in society, conflict persists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all must work for peace.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the event, Sagar Bhante stated that there are \u201ctwo Lumbinis within Lumbini\u201d and emphasised the need to now work for the upliftment of residents living outside the Lumbini Development Trust area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWealthy Buddhists from around the world are willing to invest. Work can be done in coordination with local bodies and according to the law,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program, which runs until Saturday, has drawn 25 billionaires from various countries. Leaders and scholars from Nepal and abroad, cultural ambassadors from the United Nations, internationally recognised business figures, artists, youth, and community representatives are also participating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the three days, the program will host discussions on peace, climate change, development, inner well-being, and social justice. Program coordinator Shekhar Gautam said the event would also highlight youth, women, Indigenous communities, and marginalised voices focused on local governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will also include cultural exhibitions, music, and artistic performances.</p>\n",

He made the remarks during an interactive session at the third edition of the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tag/world-peace-program\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"39604\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">World Peace Program</a> held at the Lumbini International Conference Hall. The session was moderated by Sudhamshu Dahal, Associate Professor at Kathmandu University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on his own turbulent political journey, Layne said his life had been shaped by both violence and peace. \u201cIn my earlier life, I was involved in a revolutionary movement, mostly violent, and later for 16 years I went through a war during the Derg Regime that took the lives of 70,000 people. It was a fight against the military government,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said Ethiopia\u2019s transformation began in 1991, when his party took power after 16 years of armed struggle. \u201cWe did two most important things. First, we created peace and ended the era of war. Second, we brought all political forces together. We gathered everyone for the end of poverty, and because of that the nation became peaceful,\u201d he said. For nearly a decade, Ethiopia became one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies, he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layne emphasized that sustainable peace depends on leaders who can rise above ego and personal gain. \u201cThe most important thing for leaders to foster peace is to start from themselves. I call it the leadership of humility, it cuts selfishness and motivates politicians to live for others and work for the betterment of society,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning to Nepal, he stressed that the country urgently needs leaders who can resist self-interest and remain committed to integrity. \u201cA leader who avoids being egoistic can be loyal to the nation. I believe Nepal has a young generation that can give birth to this kind of leader,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing the growing influence of technology, Layne said the digital age offers both opportunities and dangers. \u201cWe can\u2019t skip technology as it is ruling our life. We should use technology for development, not for conflict and hatred,\u201d he said, adding that dialogue, not violence, is the path to resolving differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also called for greater creativity, freedom, and intellectual vibrancy, describing them as drivers of empowerment and economic progress. \u201cThe intellectual elite is responsible for change. If they become vibrant, change is possible. They should organize new ideas,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Since the movement had no organised demands beforehand, there was a growing risk that the issues raised during the protests would fade away without formal recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, some groups within Gen Z sought to formally register their demands with the state. However, long disagreements persisted over what issues should be documented. On Wednesday, both sides reached an agreement at Singha Durbar to formally institutionalise the movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although an interim government had been formed in the aftermath of the protests, a formal agreement has come only three months later. Growing frustration among Gen Z over the criminalisation of the movement and their continued pressure eventually pushed both sides toward signing the agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gen Z had warned of returning to the streets if the government delayed further. They not only exerted pressure but also submitted their own draft agreement to the government. Based on that draft, both sides held multiple rounds of discussions and finalised a ten-point agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following are the key points included in the agreement:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Recognition and compensation for martyrs and injured</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who lost their lives during the protests of Bhadra 23\u201324 will be declared martyrs. Their families and the injured will receive compensation, free health care, education, employment opportunities, social security, and memorial arrangements. A permanent commission will also be formed to promote integrity, good governance, and anti-corruption measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Investigation of the Bhadra 23\u201324 incidents</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A high-level inquiry commission formed by the government will investigate excessive use of force and extrajudicial killings and recommend criminal action against perpetrators. Protesters will not face criminal charges for participating in political activities. A separate mechanism will be created for institutional reforms to prevent such incidents in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Ending corruption and political patronage</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A high-level commission will investigate the lifestyles and properties of individuals holding public office. Appointments based on political party quotas will be abolished. Foundations, funds, and trusts operated in the names of political leaders and parties will be examined, and illegally acquired assets will be nationalised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Free and fair elections, and provision of NOTA</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ballot papers will include the NOTA option, \u201cNone of the Above.\u201d Mandatory primary elections will be introduced within political parties. Party presidents will be limited to a maximum of two terms. Voting rights for Nepalis abroad, migrant workers, and students will be ensured. Candidate and party expenditure must be made transparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only candidates selected through mandatory internal primaries will be eligible to contest national elections. The Election Commission will determine party and candidate symbols through a lottery system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Formation of a constitutional amendment recommendation commission</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A high-level commission comprising independent experts, Gen Z representatives, and stakeholders will be formed to recommend constitutional amendments while preserving the constitution\u2019s fundamental principles. This \u201cConstitution Amendment Suggestion Commission\u201d will hold extensive discussions and public consultations before providing recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commission will conduct a ten-year review of constitutional implementation, identifying achievements and shortcomings, and propose measures to enhance effectiveness. It will also gather public input on limiting the tenure of the country\u2019s head of state, the executive heads of all three tiers of government, and cabinet members to a maximum of two full terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Full proportional inclusivity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maximum representation will be ensured for women, Dalits, Indigenous nationalities, Madhesi, Tharu, Muslim, minority groups, people with disabilities, marginalised communities, farmers, labourers, and economically disadvantaged Khas Arya. The Gen Z Council will serve in an advisory role.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Transparency and accountability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Government decisions and expenditures will be made transparent and easily accessible to the public through social media. Reports of all past inquiry commissions will be made public. Transparent and competitive processes will be ensured for appointments to public positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Freedom of expression and digital rights</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement guarantees that no form of arbitrary censorship will be imposed on the internet or digital media. Legal and technical measures will be introduced to prevent unlawful surveillance and misuse of citizens\u2019 digital data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Formation of the Gen Z council</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A Gen Z Council will be established to advise, monitor, and support the government in governance, accountability, and good governance reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. Implementation of the agreement</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All points mentioned above will be implemented. From the date of signing, the agreement will take effect and will be implemented based on mutual consent between the Government of Nepal and representatives of the Gen Z movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The day is observed annually on December 11 as per the calls of the United Nations to raise awareness about mountain importance, development challenges, and opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year the day is being commemorated under the theme &#8220;Glaciers matter for water, food, and livelihoods in mountains and beyond.&#8221; The day also highlights issues like climate change impacts on glaciers, water security, and sustainable livelihoods in mountainous regions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various events, webinars, photo contests, social media campaigns and local restoration projects are being carried out under the event. It may be noted that the United Nations General Assembly had proclaimed 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers\u2019 Preservation to raise awareness on the vital role glaciers, snow and ice play in the climate system and water cycle, as well as the far-reaching impacts of rapid glacial melt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Food and Agriculture Organisation, (FAO), a UN agency, glaciers and ice sheets hold around 70 percent of the world&#8217;s freshwater. Their accelerated melting represents not only an environmental crisis, but a humanitarian one, threatening agriculture, clean energy, water security and billions of peoples\u2019 lives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their retreat, driven by rising global temperatures, is a stark indicator of the climate crisis. Melting glaciers and thawing permafrost increase risks such as floods, glacier lake outburst floods, landslides or enhanced erosion and sediment, endangering downstream populations and critical infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Economically, sectors like agriculture, hydropower, mountain tourism and transportation feel the strain of glacier changes. For many Indigenous Peoples, glaciers are sacred, and their disappearance signifies a loss of identity and connection to nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>International Mountain Day is being celebrated since the UN&#8217;s 1992 Agenda 21 recognizing mountain ecosystems, leading to 2002 being declared the International Year of Mountains (IMD). This spurred the UN General Assembly to establish IMD in 2003 to raise awareness about mountains&#8217; crucial role (water, biodiversity, livelihoods) and the threats they face (climate change). </p>\n",

The complaints were made from various parts of the country to the toll-free helpline established by the Commission. Of the registered cases in the last six years, 88 percent were reports of domestic violence against women. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Commission Secretary Rekha Kandel, the age group of women who were reported to have been subjected to violence is between 26 and 40 years. The data of the past six years of reports received to the Commission&#8217;s helpline 1145 also states that women with low literacy rates are more likely to be subjected to violence. This information was shared during an event held on Wednesday to mark the eighth establishment day of the &#8216;National Women&#8217;s Commission, 1145 Free Helpline Service&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last fiscal year, the Commission stated that 1,202 complaints of violence against women were registered in connection with domestic violence and deprivation of women&#8217;s rights. Commission Chairperson Kamala Kumari Parajuli expressed her commitment to work actively in the field of women&#8217;s rights in the coming days as in the past. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same event, Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS) journalist Sharmila Pathak was honored for her sensitivity in the field of gender justice and for raising awareness through her news reports. Other media workers and employees of the Commission were also honoured at the event.</p>\n",

Made on a budget of INR 2.8 billion, the film collected INR 1.2625 billion in India and INR 1.93 billion worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday alone, the film earned INR 232.5 million, indicating that its momentum at the box office has not slowed down. Meanwhile, significant news has emerged regarding the film\u2019s OTT deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Producer Aditya Dhar has reportedly signed a deal worth more than INR 1 billion with an OTT platform for the film\u2019s digital streaming rights. According to Bollywood Hungama, the OTT rights were sold at a high price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film, which was released on Friday, has been confirmed to premiere on Netflix. Quoting sources, Bollywood Hungama reported that Netflix purchased the streaming rights to Ranveer Singh\u2019s spy-action film for INR 1.3 billion, though there is a twist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the report, the deal with Netflix covers both parts of the franchise. This means that both <em>Dhurandhar</em> Part 1 and <em>Dhurandhar</em> Part 2 will be released on the same OTT platform, with streaming rights valued at INR 650 million each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film has been produced under the banners of Jio Studios and B62 Studios by Jyoti Deshpande, Aditya Dhar, and Lokesh Dhar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources said that at a time when OTT prices have generally declined, this deal stands out as a massive figure and is a big relief for Ranveer Singh. Taken together, the combined payment for both parts makes this the biggest OTT deal of the actor\u2019s career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, Netflix had bought the OTT rights to Ranveer\u2019s 2021 sports drama <em>83</em> for INR 300 million. The 2023 release <em>Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani</em> had sold its streaming rights to Amazon Prime Video for INR 800 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dhurandhar</em> Part 2 has not yet been released and is scheduled to hit theatres during Eid next year on March 19, 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for its OTT release, Netflix viewers will have to wait. Typically, there is an eight-week window after theatrical release, meaning the film is expected to stream on Netflix from mid-February to the first week of March.</p>\n",

During this period, I will work to deliver excellent results at the Authority. I will continue to work in coordination with the government.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He made the remarks after the court overturned the decision to remove him without due process. The Supreme Court had reversed the government\u2019s decision, after which Shakya returned to the Authority and stated that he would work together with the government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said his priority would be to ensure the public receives sustainable and reliable electricity. \u201cFor a long time, the Authority itself did not produce electricity and relied only on companies for generation. In the coming days, the Authority itself will also increase electricity production,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shakya stated that he was not shaken despite being targeted because of his position. Recalling his over three decades of selfless service at the Authority, he said, \u201cI am not afraid. I will continue to serve the Authority and the country.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said he received justice because the court heard the case in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn my previous term, I faced injustice because the court did not hear the case in time. Even then, I did not demand a verdict in my favor. I only asked for a timely hearing, but the hearing was postponed nearly 35 times. This time, the hearing was held on time, and I received justice,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Supreme Court on Monday annulled the Cabinet\u2019s decision of October 5 to transfer Shakya to the Water and Energy Commission and appoint Manoj Silwal as Executive Director of the Authority, stating that the decision was unlawful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the mandamus order reached the Authority on Tuesday, Shakya went to join his office on Wednesday. Shakya, who had been appointed Executive Director on March 24, 2025, was removed from the post soon after Kulman Ghising, the former Executive Director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, was appointed Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation through the backing of the Gen-Z movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The court stated that Shakya had been removed from his post in a \u201cbiased,\u201d \u201cvindictive,\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d manner, and issued a mandamus order against the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the order of the joint bench of Justices Dr Nahakul Subedi and Shrikant Poudel, Shakya will now be able to serve his full term at the Nepal Electricity Authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

While Nepal\u2019s strategic importance as a geographical buffer state presents an opportunity for development, the country\u2019s weak sovereignty and prolonged internal instability have turned this opportunity into a serious geopolitical risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s future now depends on how it manages the geo-economic and geopolitical dimensions of major infrastructure and development aid projects, particularly the US-funded MCC (Millennium Challenge Corporation) and China\u2019s BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s traditional principle of non-alignment in foreign policy is now in crisis. The US has leveraged the MCC grant as a tool to project power and expand its sphere of influence as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy. Countering this, China is using connectivity and development aid through the BRI, but with the evident danger of debt diplomacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This intense competition has constrained Nepal into a position where it must choose sides. Instead of maintaining diplomatic balance, political parties are prioritizing short-term power equations over national interest, causing the country to fail in maintaining a balance of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acceptance of the <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/mcc-board-approves-nearly-rs-7-billion-grant-increase.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US MCC grant</a> was seen as an effort to expand Western interests in Nepal\u2019s geo-economics. This created a deep political conflict within Nepal&#8217;s political circles, with communist parties opposing it by linking it to a security alliance. In 2021, when the bilateral agreement was ratified, the Maoist Center, due to external and internal pressure, adopted a middle path of passing it with an Interpretive Declaration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident exposed the bitter reality that Nepal\u2019s political leadership often fails to maintain a sovereign stance and succumbs to foreign pressure. It is clear that Nepal has failed to achieve diplomatic balance, when it should have avoided becoming Ground Zero. On the other hand, although Nepal signed China&#8217;s ambitious BRI in 2017, its projects have not gained concrete momentum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>China&#8217;s core institutional interest is to make Nepal a land-linked nation and establish a<a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/09/28/nepal-china-commit-to-advancing-key-connectivity-projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. </a>However, international criticism over high-interest rates and debt diplomacy, as seen in countries like Sri Lanka, has made the Nepali leadership wary of the loan conditions, raising the risk of economic colonialism in Nepal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a counter-strategy, after the MCC&#8217;s ratification, there are allegations that China viewed it as a US &#8220;checkmate&#8221; and attempted to draw its communist strategic partners in Nepal closer through ideological and defense diplomacy. Nepal\u2019s inability to fully expedite the economic corridors under the BRI until it secures grant-based projects highlights a limitation that fuels strategic ambiguity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foreign policy of Nepal\u2019s main political parties changes according to their power equations and strategic stances, further complicating the geo-economic game. The Nepali Congress emphasizes bilateralism with Western powers, while the UML stresses nationalism and strategic balance with China. The policy of the Maoist Centre, however, remains unstable and power-centric; it is seen at times adopting a strategy of Western hedging and at other times closer proximity to China. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such fragmentation among the parties makes it easier for foreign powers to individually influence Nepal&#8217;s leaders and advance their interests. This has increased bilateral pressure instead of fostering multilateralism. These geo-economic projects have also created risks to Nepal&#8217;s sensitivity and national security. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>China&#8217;s infrastructure development on the border and India\u2019s road construction in disputed areas (Kalapani, Lipulekh, Limpiyadhura) have exacerbated border disputes and the issue of geocartography. Growing foreign investment and control over water resources could limit Nepal&#8217;s sovereign utilization of its water resources in the long term. This increases the risk that regional powers could pressure Nepal through water diplomacy in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lack of internal preparedness and the new dimension of geo-economics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal has shown a serious weakness in building bargaining capacity to manage external geo-economic pressure. Before accepting any major project, Nepal lacks a clear national priority checklist or legal empowerment. There has been no effort to regulate projects like the MCC and BRI through a single special law or body, separating them from political tug-of-war. This means Nepal has consistently reacted to the agendas of foreign powers instead of setting its own independent agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, a new dimension of digital dominance has been added to the geo-economic game. Investments in 5G networks, information technology, and cyber security have become new fronts for expanding the interests of major powers. Nepal has not been able to clearly define its digital strategic stance alongside physical connectivity. Failure to address the risks of increased foreign control over Nepal&#8217;s internal data security and geospatial information will certainly create further threats to national security in the future. To escape this geopolitical squeeze, &#8216;Project-Oriented Sovereignty&#8217; is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure of geo-economics is no longer limited to development projects; it is even influencing Nepal&#8217;s federal structure. Major powers have begun adopting a strategy of bypassing the federal government by bringing in direct foreign investment and grants at the provincial level. This increases the possibility of the balance of power within the federal structure collapsing and the center weakening. When provincial or local leaders prioritize external agendas without considering the national long-term interest, Nepal&#8217;s overall sovereignty is affected. Therefore, it is essential for Nepal to establish national standards and a code of conduct for development aid and implement them at every level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lessons from world history and Nepal&#8217;s critical takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal must learn serious lessons from the history of nations that were ruined or lost their sovereignty by getting caught in a geopolitical squeeze.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Afghanistan</strong> &#8211; The Graveyard of Empires Revisited: Afghanistan was a buffer state in the 19th-century Great Game and a battleground for both the Soviet Union and the US during the Cold War. Continuous development aid and intervention by external powers empowered internal groups with ideology and weaponry, plunging the country into civil war. The internal division in Nepal over the MCC and BRI shows the danger of this history repeating itself. Foreign powers are easily exploiting Nepal&#8217;s political instability to expand their sphere of influence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lebanon</strong> &#8211; Prey to Regional Powers: Lebanon\u2019s civil war was not purely an internal conflict but a proxy war of regional powers like Israel, Syria, and Iran. In a weak internal political system, local parties became \u2018proxies\u2019 for regional agendas, which eroded sovereignty. The way Nepal&#8217;s parties change their strategic stances under foreign pressure and prioritize momentary power aligns with Lebanon&#8217;s situation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Yemen </strong>&#8211; Squeezed by Oil and Ideology: The Yemen conflict is a clear example of geopolitical competition between Iran (Shia power) and Saudi Arabia (Sunni power). Internal groups were continuously provided with external support based on ideology and control over vital sea lanes. If continuous external support is provided to one side in Nepal to counter the other, the country will remain limited by conflict and underdevelopment for a long time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Congo</strong> &#8211; The Curse of Geo-economics: The abundance of precious minerals like cobalt and copper in Congo led to various institutional interests and direct intervention by neighboring nations. This weakened the principle of multilateralism and focused on looting long-term national wealth. Growing foreign control over Nepal&#8217;s water resources could bring about limitations similar to those in Congo in the future. This is the biggest threat to Nepal, which could deprive the country of ownership over its resources.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Syria</strong> &#8211; Battleground for Global Powers: The Syrian civil war was a result of direct intervention by powers like Russia, Iran, the US, and Turkey over their strategic stances and spheres of influence. This war not only completely devastated the nation but also displaced millions of citizens. If external powers use military and non-military cooperation as a competition by exploiting Nepal&#8217;s internal instability, a disastrous situation like Syria&#8217;s could arise.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal\u2019s internal instability is the main reason for inviting these external threats. If Nepal fails to establish its independent will, it risks being caught in the geopolitical squeeze and ruined like these nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Success in the great power game</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when caught in a geopolitical squeeze like Nepal, various nations have successfully utilized external competition as a means to obtain development assistance and strengthen their strategic position. The experience of nations that achieved prosperity by maintaining geo-economic and geopolitical balance is highly relevant for Nepal. The core mantra of their success is clearly seen in building bargaining capacity by focusing on internal unity, transparency, legal empowerment, and the national long-term interest. These examples offer a practical roadmap for Nepal on how to become a successful &#8216;balancer&#8217; among world powers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Vietnam&#8217;s Diversification of Multilateral Investment</strong>: After its long history of conflict, Vietnam adopted a policy of equal distance with the US (Western investment) and China (geographical and economic proximity). It embraced multilateralism, using the world\u2019s major powers to counter each other and diversify foreign investment. Due to this strategy, Vietnam successfully integrated its economy into the global supply chain, resulting in rapid economic growth. Vietnam strengthened its strategic position by focusing on economic cooperation while avoiding any security alliances.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oman\u2019s Role as a Neutral Mediator</strong>: Located in the unstable Middle East, Oman played the role of a &#8216;neutral mediator&#8217; to maintain diplomatic balance among conflicting powers like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the US. Its foreign policy is based on a &#8216;zero-problem&#8217; approach, meaning it holds no hostility toward any country. Oman ensured respect and economic cooperation from all sides without falling into any sphere of interest. Its clear strategic stance helped it stay away from regional conflicts and maintain stability in its waterways and oil economy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Indonesia\u2019s Active-Independent Policy</strong>: Since the Cold War, Indonesia has adopted an &#8216;Active-Independent&#8217; foreign policy between the US and the Soviet Union/China. This policy aims to secure the national interest by not joining any one bloc and maintaining friendship with all major powers. Indonesia used the power of its large market and natural resources to balance by accepting infrastructure investment from China (e.g., BRI projects) and technology and security cooperation from the US and Japan. This shifted bilateral pressure to multilateralism, working for the country&#8217;s long-term interest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finland and Sweden&#8217;s Steadfast Neutrality:</strong> During the Cold War, Finland and Sweden maintained an extremely sensitive diplomatic balance between the Soviet Union and Western powers. They adopted a policy of complete military non-alignment, a policy known as &#8216;Finlandization&#8217; in Finland&#8217;s context. This clear and steadfast strategic stance prevented their internal instability from escalating and allowed them to continue economic development by drawing commercial and technological benefits from both sides.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Malaysia&#8217;s Practical Neutrality:</strong> Malaysia accepted China&#8217;s large investments and infrastructure plans but simultaneously maintained deep security and economic ties with Western partners like the US, Japan, and Australia. While cooperating with China for economic benefits, it maintained diplomatic balance with Western powers for the security and sovereignty of its waterways. Malaysia ensured legal empowerment and transparency, regulating the terms of foreign investment according to national interest, which liberated it from the political pressure of any single power.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion and the concrete way forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To break through the geo-economic labyrinth, Nepal now needs not just the slogan of &#8216;neutrality&#8217; but a concrete strategy of &#8216;Project-Oriented Sovereignty&#8217; and internal unity. Establishing Nepal&#8217;s independent will requires a singular commitment from the political leadership to abandon momentary power interests and focus on the long-term benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s bright future must be based on reform and empowerment. Foreign projects should be welcomed with a strategic stance, ensuring no involvement in any security alliance, making loan conditions transparent and fair, and guaranteeing that the benefits of development aid from every project directly reach the Nepali people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parties must establish a common minimum understanding on national issues to enhance bargaining capacity. Through legal empowerment, all projects like the MCC or BRI must be regulated by a single standard, separating them from political contention. Only by maintaining internal unity and transparency can Nepal transform its sensitivity into a &#8216;security shield&#8217; and a &#8216;door to development&#8217; and play the role of a successful &#8216;balancer&#8217; among world powers. Utilizing its natural and human potential to the fullest, Nepal must firmly establish its foreign policy with confidence, rather than resorting to mere hedging.</p>\n",

Named \u201c<a href=\"https://www.s2s.antarikchya.org.np/#:~:text=%22Slipper%20to%20Sat%22%20means%20the,are%20desperate%20to%20buy%20slippers!\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.s2s.antarikchya.org.np/#:~:text=%22Slipper%20to%20Sat%22%20means%20the,are%20desperate%20to%20buy%20slippers!\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slippers to Sat</a>,\u201d the satellite was launched at 9:45 this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Project Manager Rishab Adhikari informed that the satellite has already reached space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt has reached space. We will establish an online connection with it at around 12 PM. For that, we are heading to NAST\u2019s ground station. Once it comes online, we will consider it our initial success,\u201d Adhikari told Onlinekhabar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tube-shaped nano-satellite weighs 1.2 kilograms and is equipped with two high-capacity cameras. These cameras can capture real-time images and collect data on Nepal\u2019s vegetation cover and water resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important feature of the satellite is its earthquake early warning system. Adhikari explained that the satellite includes technology capable of detecting micro electromagnetic waves generated before an earthquake and providing early alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The satellite is also equipped with an electromagnetic system that allows it to halt its motion and adjust its orbit directly from Earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the original plan, the satellite was expected to operate for at least five years. However, the Sun\u2019s 25th solar cycle has reached its peak (solar maximum), which means solar radiation will be extremely intense. Due to this, the launch team now estimates that the satellite\u2019s orbital lifetime may be shortened, and it may function for only around one and a half years. The project was carried out with technical support from amateur radio digital communication, and children from the Chepang community in Chitwan were also involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All data transmitted from the satellite will be freely accessible to licensed amateur radio frequency holders and institutions worldwide. \u201cSlippers to Sat\u201d is the third satellite made from Nepal through coordination with the private sector.</p>\n",

Since this is a knockout fixture, the losing team will see its journey come to an end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even the winning team will not directly enter the final. To reach the championship match, it must clear one more hurdle,&nbsp; the second qualifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Sudurpaschim Royals defeated Biratnagar Kings in the first qualifier to book their place in the final. The winner of today\u2019s Eliminator will face Biratnagar Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu have defeated Lumbini in both of their encounters so far. Kathmandu will aim to maintain that dominance, while Lumbini will be determined to win today and knock Kathmandu out of the title race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Current form</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both teams have shown fluctuations in form during this edition of the NPL. Neither side has managed to maintain consistent momentum throughout the tournament.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu began by defeating defending champions Janakpur Bolts in the opening match but then suffered two back-to-back losses. They bounced back strongly by winning the next four matches to secure a playoff spot. Despite finishing with 10 points, equal to Biratnagar Kings, they had to settle for third place due to an inferior net run rate, putting them in the Eliminator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu has appeared heavily dependent on their foreign players. English batters Ben Charlesworth and John Simpson have played particularly crucial roles. Gerhard Erasmus contributed moderately but is unavailable for the playoffs. Milind Kumar\u2019s all-round performance has also been key for Kathmandu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Kathmandu did not sign foreign bowlers, they must rely mainly on Nepali bowlers for their bowling attack. Part-time spinner Milind Kumar is the only overseas bowler in the squad. The Nepali bowlers will need to put in exceptional effort if the team is to reach the final.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlesworth earlier said that if the bowlers perform well, the team is capable of winning the title.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur bowlers are doing well, Shahab has been brilliant in this tournament. Their lengths are good, and they have been consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are executing our plans well, and we are hopeful of winning the title.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumbini Lions, on the other hand, began with a win against Chitwan Rhinos but then suffered three consecutive defeats. Despite those setbacks, they made a remarkable comeback by winning their final three matches to secure a playoff spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the middle of the tournament, Lumbini changed both their foreign players and team combination, a move that brought positive results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to Kathmandu, Lumbini\u2019s progress has been driven primarily by Nepali players. Both their batting and bowling charts are led by domestic players, supported by their overseas recruits. Captain Rohit Paudel is the tournament\u2019s highest run-scorer, while Sher Malla leads the wicket tally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With improvements in both batting and bowling, Lumbini, too, emerged as strong contenders for the title. Captain Rohit Paudel echoed similar confidence: \u201cOther teams have looked good as well, but I feel we are slightly better,\u201d he said after reaching the playoffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Head-to-Head</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu and Lumbini have faced each other twice across the two editions of the NPL, Kathmandu won on both occasions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their first meeting, a low-scoring thriller, Kathmandu defended 103 by bowling out Lumbini for 85 to claim an 18-run victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second edition, Kathmandu posted 157 in 20 overs and successfully defended the total by bowling out Lumbini for 135.</p>\n",

According to the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the economy grew by 4.61 per cent in FY 2024/25, up from 3.67 per cent the previous year. Inflation has cooled to 4.06 per cent, easing cost pressures on households. Sectoral performance is also encouraging: industry grew by 4.53 per cent, services by 4.21 per cent, and agriculture by 3.28 per cent. Exports have picked up, remittance inflows remain strong, and foreign-exchange reserves are also stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a first glance, these numbers suggest that Nepal is regaining stability and regrowth after years of turmoil. Yet behind the macroeconomic recovery, structural vulnerabilities persist. A study by researchers at Tribhuvan University shows that the informal economy still accounts for roughly 38.6 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, according to labor-market data compiled by Rastriya Shramik Mahasangh Nepal (RSM Nepal), about 84.6 per cent of employment remains informal, and the official unemployment rate stands at 10.71 per cent, with youth unemployment among the young working-age population at a worrying 20.82 per cent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means a huge chunk of economic activity and earnings are unregistered, unregulated, and beyond tax or social-security systems. On top of that, a significant majority of workers &nbsp;especially youth either struggle to find good formal jobs or end up in under-paid, unstable work. For Nepal to sustain growth, generate decent jobs, and transform its youthful population into an asset rather than a liability, we need a structural shift and that shift can begin with the youth themselves.&nbsp;For the digitally savvy generation commonly referred to as Gen Z, this is the moment to pivot: to launch Nepal\u2019s gig-economy boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gig economy in Nepal</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ride-sharing-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-571747\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Asian Productivity Organization\u2019s Productivity Data Book 2025, the gig economy contributes around 7 per cent of Nepal\u2019s GDP. Platforms like <a href=\"https://english.onlinekhabar.com/over-125000-ride-share-riders-1-million-users-in-nepal-amid-legal-grey-zone.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ride-sharing</a> (Pathao, InDrive, Yango), delivery (Foodmandu, Daraz, Upaya), freelancing, and outsourcing are expanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one platform alone reportedly provides jobs to over 200,000 people (including motorbike riders, cab drivers, and delivery personnel). The gig economy is increasingly accessible to women, students, rural youths, and others who may lack formal qualifications because many gigs require only a smartphone and internet access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift indicates that for many in Gen Z especially those in urban or semi-urban areas or those with digital skills gig work offers a way to earn without depending on formal employers or having to migrate abroad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The challenges and ways out</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its growth and appeal, the gig economy in Nepal suffers from several structural and regulatory problems. A 2024 survey of gig workers found widespread concerns: about legal ambiguity, lack of social security, health risks, income instability, and absence of savings or financial safety nets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if &nbsp;Nepal\u2019s Gen Z is ready to hustle, there\u2019s a difference between side-hustle and sustainable growth. Therefore, the government should legalize gig work as real work, invest in digital infrastructure, and support youth entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019 AD, the Government of Nepal launched the <a href=\"https://giwmscdnone.gov.np/media/app/public/22/posts/1663305162_66.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Digital Nepal Framework</a> with the goal of harnessing economic growth through digital technology and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the effective implementation of this framework is hindered by disorganized coordination among the responsible ministries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we act now by empowering tech savvy Gen Z, making strategic policy, drafting legal monitoring and effective complaints handling system, inclusive tax coverage, safeguarding the gig workers\u2019 rights, upgrading infrastructure, ensuring job security, fair remuneration and embracing the gig economy Nepal could unlock a digital dividend. A wave of youth-led digital income, entrepreneurship, foreign-exchange earnings, and formal savings all contributing to a more diversified, modern, and resilient economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal&#8217;s recent macroeconomic data shows signs of recovery. But numbers alone &#8211; GDP growth (4.61 per cent) or low inflation (4.06 per cent) cannot guarantee long-term prosperity. That is just the runway. The real takeoff starts when young generation step into the cockpit: launching freelancing careers, building digital agencies, earning remotely for global clients, and transforming gig work from informal hustle to formal growth engine. For Gen Z, the gig revolution is not just about side income it\u2019s a pathway to reshape the next chapter of Nepal\u2019s economic story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Nepal seizes this moment well, the slogan \u201cThe Gig Economy and Gen Z\u201d would not just be a catchy tagline. It could become the foundation of the country\u2019s leapfrog growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Once a major industry that met the country\u2019s paper demand and even exported pulp to Japan, the factory has now deteriorated into a dilapidated structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built by the Chinese government to help Nepal become self-reliant in paper production, the factory was shut down on Falgun 19, 2067 following privatisation. After the management unilaterally posted a notice announcing the closure, 333 permanent workers were left unpaid. More than a dozen workers have since died due to various reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the law requires formal notification to the Department of Labour before closing an industry, the operators shut the factory without obtaining approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The factory premises are now overgrown with bushes and have turned into wasteland. Security guards said jackals howl there in the evenings. \u201cAll the structures are in a ruined state, covered by bushes, and it is not possible to enter inside,\u201d a guard said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tin roofs have rusted and collapsed. From outside, only skeletal frames are visible. The walls have crumbled, allowing easy entry from anywhere. A few guards barely manage to guard the main gate. It is impossible to reach the areas where machines and tools were kept.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Once exporting paper, the country turned import-dependent after the closure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bhrikuti-Kagaj-Karkhana-Gaindakot-17-1024x576-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576752\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At one time, this factory met nearly 60 per cent of the country\u2019s total paper demand. Using domestic raw materials such as straw, bamboo, babiyo grass, wheat husk, kans grass from the national parks, and waste paper, it used to produce 12,000 to 15,000 metric tons of paper daily. After its sudden closure, Indian paper products have flooded the Nepali market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bhrikuti exported 1,500 metric tons of raw paper annually to Japan and up to 3,000 metric tons of paper to India. With the factory\u2019s shutdown, not only did hundreds lose their livelihoods, but the country also became dependent on imports for paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there were repeated written agreements between the workers\u2019 representatives and factory management to pay the dues, the management has not paid wages to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 300 permanent workers who had been working at the factory have not received their salaries and allowances since Mangsir 2067 BS. Meanwhile, 22 temporary workers, 44 contract workers, and 92 probationary workers were paid their dues and dismissed immediately after the factory was closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2049 BS (1992/93), under the government of then Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and its policy of transferring state responsibilities to the private sector, the Bhrikuti Paper Factory along with 60 bighas of land was sold to Golchha Organization, Kabra Group and Kankraft. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it was said that the group purchased the factory, which produced eight tons of paper daily, for Rs 170 million, sources claim it was acquired for only Rs 129.8 million. The operators later sold eight bighas of land separately. They also received a concession of nearly Rs 50 million from the government in relation to continuing government employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Built by China, decline began after privatisation</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bhrikuti-Kagaj-Karkhana-Gaindakot-21-1024x576-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576753\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The factory, constructed by the Chinese government in 2039 BS (1982/83) and handed over to the Government of Nepal to make the country self-reliant in paper, began to decline after it was privatised in 2049 BS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some have demanded the factory be brought back into operation, others have argued that due to dense settlement in Gaidakot, it should be relocated elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demand for settlement of overdue wages</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"670\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bhrikuti-Kagaj-Karkhana-Gaindakot-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576754\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Workers have been continuously demanding the settlement of their long-overdue wages, saying they have suffered greatly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darsan Sapkota, coordinator of the Victims\u2019 Workers Struggle Committee, said the problem must be resolved by the central government. \u201cWe have informed everyone from the central government to the local level about workers\u2019 problems,\u201d Sapkota said. \u201cThere is no one unaware of Bhrikuti\u2019s situation. We have submitted all documents related to past agreements and legal cases, but the problem has not been resolved.\u201d He complained that no one has spoken up against the injustice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bhrikuti-Kagaj-Karkhana-Gaindakot-29-1024x576-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576755\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bhrikuti-Kagaj-Karkhana-Gaindakot-34-1024x576-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576756\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The winner of this match will face the loser of the first Qualifier in the second Qualifier, and the winner of that match will reach the final.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How have the four playoff teams performed so far? Let\u2019s take a closer look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sudurpashchim Royals</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"832\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sudurpaschim-vs-biratnagar_kings-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576798\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudurpashchim Royals, who topped the league table last season as well, enter the playoffs this year as the table-toppers once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudurpashchim secured the top position early by winning their first six matches in a row. They lost their final league game to Biratnagar Kings, whom they will face again in the first Qualifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sudurpashchim have excelled in all three departments, batting, bowling, and fielding. Led by Nepal national team vice-captain and all-rounder Dipendra Singh Airee, they lost only their final match and displayed strong performances in their remaining games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the top order, Binod Bhandari, Chris Lynn, and Josh Brown have performed well. In the middle and lower order, captain Dipendra, along with Ishan Pandey, Arif Sheikh, and Harmeet Singh, have contributed significantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dipendra himself has contributed across all departments, scoring 146 runs, taking seven wickets, and adding catches and direct-hit run-outs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign players as well as Nepali players have performed strongly for Sudurpashchim. Nepali players lead both the run-scoring and wicket-taking charts for the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binod Bhandari is the highest run-scorer with 201 runs, including one half-century, in seven matches. Abinash Bohara leads in bowling with 14 wickets in seven matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Lynn and Brown will not be available for the playoffs. They have been replaced by American batter Mukhtar Ahmed and Indian batter Sheldon Jackson, from whom strong performances will be expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coach Jagat Tamata said that the team has performed well in both batting and bowling, and credited both the players and the support staff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur batting and bowling units have taken responsibility. I want to thank the team management and support staff. At the moment, our bowling looks like our biggest strength,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sudurpashchim Royals\u2019 Form:</strong> 6 wins, 1 loss<br><strong>Top Runs:</strong> Binod Bhandari (201), Arif Sheikh (160), Dipendra Singh Airee (146), Chris Lynn (143), Ishan Pandey (114)<br><strong>Top Wickets:</strong> Abinash Bohara (14), Harmeet Singh (10), Scott Kuggeleijn (8), Dipendra Singh Airee (7), Hemant Dhami (6)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biratnagar Kings</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"832\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/biratnagar-vs-lumbini-3-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576799\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Biratnagar, who missed the playoffs in the first edition, made headlines before this season by signing South African star batter Faf du Plessis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also retained New Zealand\u2019s Martin Guptill and signed South African pace bowler Merchant de Lange and Australian BBL star Sam Hain, giving the team a formidable look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biratnagar started strongly, winning their first three matches and showing strong playoff potential. But Chitwan Rhinos handed them their first loss in the fourth match. In the fifth match, Biratnagar defeated Karnali Yaks with Basir Ahmed\u2019s standout performance, but then lost to Lumbini in the sixth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite some inconsistency in the middle of the tournament, Biratnagar had already confirmed their playoff berth. However, to finish in the top two, they needed a big win against the unbeaten Sudurpashchim. In a \u201chigh-voltage\u201d match, Biratnagar ended Sudurpashchim\u2019s undefeated run and secured an impressive victory to clinch the second position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biratnagar looks balanced, with contributions from the middle order too. In bowling, captain Sandeep Lamichhane is in excellent rhythm, taking 15 wickets in seven matches, the highest in the entire tournament. Merchant de Lange has taken eight wickets and is expected to perform even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandeep has played a crucial role in almost every victory. He has also contributed cameo runs with big hits when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain Sandeep Lamichhane praised Sudurpashchim for playing very good cricket and said they will carry the positive elements from the previous match forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSudurpashchim are playing a very good brand of cricket, credit to Dipendra for that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will take today\u2019s positive things into the next match as well.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Biratnagar Kings\u2019 Form:</strong> 5 wins, 2 losses<br><strong>Top Runs:</strong> Basir Ahmed (176), Lokesh Bam (175), Martin Guptill (121), Sam Hain (116), Shubham Ranjane (87)<br><strong>Top Wickets:</strong> Sandeep Lamichhane (15), Merchant de Lange (8), Shubham Ranjane (5), Surya Tamang (4), Pratish GC (4)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kathmandu Gorkhas</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1248\" height=\"832\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/karnali-vs-kathmandu_01-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576800\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu Gorkhas, who missed the playoffs last season due to net run rate, qualified this time with enough points, though the journey was far from easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They defeated defending champions Janakpur Bolts in the opening match but then lost two in a row, losing momentum. After that, they bounced back strongly, winning four consecutive matches to secure a playoff spot. They finished third due to an inferior net run rate compared to Biratnagar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign players have played a key role for Kathmandu, especially in batting. English players Ben Charlesworth and John Simpson have been central performers, while Gerhard Erasmus contributed moderately before becoming unavailable for the playoffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of Kathmandu\u2019s top five run-scorers this season are foreign players: John Simpson, Ben Charlesworth, and Milind Kumar. Aakash Tripathi and Bhim Sharki complete the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In bowling, captain Karan KC has received support from Shahab Alam, Rashid Khan, and Milind Kumar. Shahab even delivered a record-breaking bowling performance in the final league match.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu\u2019s victories have heavily depended on foreign players. Rashid Khan, Santosh Yadav, and Adil Alam have not done well with the bat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathmandu did not sign foreign bowlers, meaning their bowling relies almost entirely on Nepali players. Aside from part-time spinner Milind Kumar, all bowlers are Nepali, and they will need to work harder to push the team toward the final.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kathmandu Gorkhas\u2019 Form:</strong> 5 wins, 2 losses<br><strong>Top Runs:</strong> Ben Charlesworth (197), John Simpson (154), Aakash Tripathi (117), Milind Kumar (113), Bhim Sharki (76)<br><strong>Top Wickets:</strong> Shahab Alam (12), Karan KC (12), Milind Kumar (10), Rashid Khan (8), Santosh Yadav (5)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lumbini Lions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"http://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lumbini-vs-janakpur_bolts-6-1024x683-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-576801\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumbini Lions, who failed to progress beyond the league stage last season, rebranded themselves this year, changing their logo, jersey, players, and coaching staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They started with a win but then suffered three consecutive losses, putting their playoff hopes in jeopardy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With only two points from their first four matches, every remaining game became a do-or-die scenario. Amid the pressure, Lumbini staged an impressive comeback, winning all their remaining three matches and qualifying for the playoffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also made changes to their foreign players and batting order during the tournament, which produced positive results. Sandeep Jora, who opened in the initial matches, was moved back to his natural middle-order/finisher role. After Sri Lankan batter Niroshan Dickwella arrived, the middle order looked more balanced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Lumbini, Nepali players lead both batting and bowling charts. Captain Rohit Paudel is the top run-scorer, while Sher Malla has taken the most wickets. Australian D\u2019arcy Short has also found form in recent matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Captain Rohit has scored 208 runs in seven matches, although his strike rate needs improvement. Short has scored 164 runs. In bowling, Sher Malla leads with 12 wickets, followed by Namibian pacer Ruben Trumpelmann with eight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All-rounder Gulbadin Naib, who can hit big shots in the middle overs and take wickets, has returned. For now, Namibian JJ Smit has been fulfilling that role effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With improvements in both batting and bowling, Lumbini could also be a strong contender for the title. Rohit echoed this sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLumbini looks in the best shape, all three teams are good, but Lumbini is looking very strong,\u201d he said after qualifying. \u201cWe have played very well in the last three matches. This shouldn\u2019t make us get carried away, but all teams are strong and Lumbini is even better.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lumbini Lions\u2019 Form:</strong> 4 wins, 3 losses<br><strong>Top Runs:</strong> Rohit Paudel (208), D\u2019arcy Short (164), Dilip Nath (113), Sandeep Jora (92), Gulbadin Naib (90)<br><strong>Top Wickets:</strong> Sher Malla (12), Ruben Trumpelmann (8), Gulbadin Naib (5), Rohit Paudel (4), Abhishek Gautam (4)</p>\n",

Scammers are misusing publicly available photos and using social media to solicit money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many artists have started speaking out about this issue on social media. A few days ago, John Chamling of the band John and The Locals openly wrote about such activities. He informed the public that someone was using his name and photo to ask for money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Swar, associated with Swapnil Sharma, has also urged people to avoid falling victim to such fraud. Purna Rai of Purna Rai and Dajubhai has likewise issued a public notice regarding this type of scam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, artists do not ask their fans for money through social media. Analysis of this trend shows that scammers usually create fake accounts using artists\u2019 names and photos, then send messages to others asking for money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stay safe, people are advised to follow artists\u2019 official accounts, check the authenticity of accounts if such messages are received, report fake accounts, and ignore messages coming from such accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
