Basically, the service now lets you create memes in which you're the star.\n\nIt really is as straightforward as it sounds, the only caveat being that the feature, called Me Meme, is right now only available in the US.\n\n\n\n\nMe Meme in Google Photos\n\nIt uses generative AI to create funny, personalized memes based on templates.
