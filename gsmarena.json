That \"G\" at the end confirms that this is in fact the model meant for markets outside of China.\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the screenshot above, the tablet managed a single-core score of 2,940 and a multi-core score of 8,759 in Geekbench 6.5. Like the Chinese variant, it's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The...</p>",

However, a new leak today claims the K14x will be powered by the Dimensity 6300 SoC.\n\n\n\nThis is the same chipset used by its predecessor, so if there are any upgrades, they will be elsewhere.

It is a simple, cheap and effective solution.\n\nSo why is it that smartphone makers have been so reluctant to adopt it, even years after the Qi standard officially added a Magnetic Charging Profile? Perhaps it’s better to ask this instead – do you care whether your phone has magnets for wireless charging?\n\n\n\nFirst, a bit of history....</p>",

At least the latter has a shot, given the right promotional discount.\n\nWhile the Realme 16 Pro+ scored pretty low, a good number of people are willing to have a second look after the price falls to more reasonable levels.
