Enter the Magic8 Pro Air, Honor’s answer to the iPhone Air and the slew of other slim Android phones that launched in recent months.\n\n\n\nHonor’s approach is a little different, as the Magic8 Pro Air features Pro-grade specs including a triple camera setup with a dedicated telephoto lens, a sizeable 5,500mAh battery and a screen that’s better suited for one-handed usability.\n\n\n\n\nHonor Magic8 Pro is remarkably slim thanks to its redesigned chassis structure...</p>",

This may very well be all the tablet you ever need.\n\nIt has a large anti-glare display, a long-lasting battery, and solid performance.
