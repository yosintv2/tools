Right now, they are only available in India, which is a shame – these two have some impressive specs and though they are a bit pricey, they could have found success in other markets too.\n\nThe Realme 16 Pro+ flaunts a 200MP main camera (1/1.56”, OIS) and a 50MP 3.5x periscope (1/2.76”, f/2.8, OIS), plus an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 50MP selfie module. It’s not perfect (video stabilization and ultra-wide videos in particular being substandard), but it is better than most mid-range phones – many of which don’t even have a...</p>",

That’s paired with quad microphones for hands-free calls, and the ability to record calls and audio in your surroundings.\n\n\n\nWe got hold of the Titanium version, which retails for €199, though Xiaomi is also offering browline and pilot styles, with the...</p>",

Oppo launched one in the Reno15 series and it was the clear winner of last week’s poll. But how successful would it be outside of its Reno15 family?\n\nThe Oppo Reno15 Pro, aka Reno15 Pro Mini in India, didn’t knock it out of the park with around a quarter of the vote going in its favor – notably, there are a lot more people who think they can get a better deal with other petite smartphones. Still, if you look at the yellow pie slice,...</p>",

Meanwhile, the foldables won’t be replaced until H2.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 is available with either a $200 straight discount or you can get trade-in credit of up to $600.\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7\n            $200 off without trade-in-or-up to $600 trade-in credit\n     ...</p>",
