It has a 4.03-inch display (an AMOLED, luckily), Android 16 with a custom Niagara Launcher, one camera on the back, oh, and a physical QWERT keyboard. The phone weighs 170g and supports swappable back panels withlots of color choices. You'll be able to get one for $499 later this year.\n\nHonor unveiled the very iPhone 17-looking Power2. The phone weighs 216g, which is impressive, given that it packs a 10,080mAh battery! The phone is on sale in China, starting from CNY...</p>",

Alas, neither phone is available in the US (and in the case of the Fold, it might not be fully unveiled until the MWC). More competition is always good, so we just have to arm ourselves with patience.\n\nWe don’t know the US price of the Signature yet, but we do know that it will cost €1,000 in Europe – the same price as the OnePlus 15. Speaking of which, here’s the OnePlus 15 at its full retail price though paired with a $100 gift card to soften the blow.\n\n\n ...</p>",

Now it introduces the Signature line to serve the premium market and the first model in it is quite interesting.\n\nThe Motorola Signature is not an all out flagship, but it costs a good deal less than those – you can pick up a 12/512GB unit for £900/€1,000 in Europe. Something like the vivo X300 Pro will run you €400 more, even the OnePlus 15 costs €1,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorola Signature\n\nThe Signature is a fairly slim and light device, measuring 7.0mm and...</p>",
