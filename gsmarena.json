The Nothing Phone (4a) Pro was first spotted in an IMEI listing all the way back in September, then a leak in December detailed both upcoming devices giving us some specs, and earlier this month Nothing confirmed a storage upgrade for at least one of the models, along with a possible price hike.\n\nNow, the Nothing Phone (4a) may have been certified in the UAE by TDRA, with the model number A069. For reference, note that the aforementioned IMEI listing of the...</p>",

The most notable thing about it, at least from the leaks we've had so far, is its form factor, which means it's much wider when folded than most of its competitors, while unfolding straight into landscape mode.\n\nThus, when unfolded, it has an aspect ratio that's more rectangular and less square than what other similar devices can offer. Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold, seen here next to a mockup of the iPhone Fold, is the exception, as it basically unfolds into a 10-inch tablet, but that one does...</p>",

And Motorola appears to be thinking the same way, as it's working on the G17.\n\n[#InlinePriceWidget,13507,1#]\n\nAn FAQ page for the G17, regarding inserting or removing a SIM card, is already live on Motorola's US support site, confirming the phone's development and also the fact that it supports microSD cards up to 1TB in size. This page also tells us that there will be a Moto G17 Power...</p>",
