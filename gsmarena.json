At least the latter has a shot, given the right promotional discount.\n\nWhile the Realme 16 Pro+ scored pretty low, a good number of people are willing to have a second look after the price falls to more reasonable levels. As we noted in our review, the Pro+ is a solid phone, but it costs more than the...</p>",

Hence, take these preliminary specs with a grain of salt. Still, the OnePlus 16 is shaping up as one heck of a flagship.\n\nThe phone’s display is said to be a flat BOE X5 OLED panel with a 1220p resolution and a whopping 240Hz refresh rate. Underneath the hood, we might see a Pro version of Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon Elite Gen 6 chipset, rumored to reach insane 6GHz clock speeds. It is paired with LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 4.1 storage. Unfortunately, the storage will be...</p>",

However, there are a few other features Google locks behind that paywall as well. Most notably – background playback.\n\nThat said, for quite some time now, crafty developers and their respective users have enjoyed ways of getting the feature for free. The simplest approach was to use a third-party browser like Samsung Internet, Brave or Vivaldi (to name a few) to play content in the background. After an avalanche of user reports over the past few days, Google has finally confirmed that it is...</p>",
