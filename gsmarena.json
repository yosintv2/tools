According to a new report, an X300e variant has now been spotted online.\n\nThe report claims that a vivo X300e has been spotted in the GSMA IMEI database. While the listing doesn’t disclose any specs, it does confirm the device’s moniker.\n\n\n\nIf the listing is accurate, this would mark the first time the X series has introduced an ‘e’ variant. Previously, vivo has launched ‘FE’ models and, more recently, the ‘T’ variant with the vivo X200T.\n\nThe vivo X Fold6 was also spotted in...</p>",

Just like with the Buds3 and Buds3 Pro, the Buds4 seem to lack a silicone tip, while the Buds4 Pro do have it.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds4 leaked renders\n\nThus you can pick your preferred style - in-ear (Buds4 Pro), or semi-in-ear (Buds4).
