In contrast to regular wireless charging, it uses magnets rather than relying on manual alignment between the charging coils or on gravity to keep the phone and charger together. It is a simple, cheap and effective solution.\n\nSo why is it that smartphone makers have been so reluctant to adopt it, even years after the Qi standard officially added a Magnetic Charging Profile? Perhaps it’s better to ask this instead – do you care whether your phone has magnets for wireless charging?\n\n\n\nFirst, a bit of history....</p>",

Meanwhile, there are some powerful flagships that used to cost €1,000 or so that may offer a better deal.\n\nThe Motorola Signature is a fairly slim and light phone (7.0mm, 186g) that is equipped with a 6.8” LTPO display (165Hz, 1264p) and a 5,200mAh battery (90W wired, 50W wireless charging). It has four 50MP cameras – 1/1.28” main (OIS), 3x/71mm telephoto (1/1.95”, OIS), 122° ultra-wide and a selfie camera.\n\nThe phone features the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 paired...</p>",

At least the latter has a shot, given the right promotional discount.\n\nWhile the Realme 16 Pro+ scored pretty low, a good number of people are willing to have a second look after the price falls to more reasonable levels.

Hence, take these preliminary specs with a grain of salt. Still, the OnePlus 16 is shaping up as one heck of a flagship.\n\nThe phone’s display is said to be a flat BOE X5 OLED panel with a 1220p resolution and a whopping 240Hz refresh rate. Underneath the hood, we might see a Pro version of Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon Elite Gen 6 chipset, rumored to reach insane 6GHz clock speeds. It is paired with LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 4.1 storage.
