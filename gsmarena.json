It’s a split design with a small camera module that detaches from the main body, which shows a live preview on its 2.27” display from around 30m/100ft away.\n\nThe advantage of this design – besides the built-in remote control functionality – is that you can flip the camera around for vlog-style videos. If this design looks familiar, you are probably thinking of the DJI Osmo Nano. The Insta360 Go Ultra is another petite action camera (that one relies on a flip-up display for vlogs).\n\n\n\nLike its competition,...</p>",

It blends \"gaming, lifestyle, and productivity in one intelligent platform\", the official press release claims.\n\nThe Motoko's dual first-person-view cameras are positioned at eye level to basically see what you see, enabling real-time object and text recognition - translating street signs, tracking gym reps, summarizing documents on the fly, all of that.\n\n\n\nThere are also dual far and near-field mics, working together to capture voice commands and pick up dialogue within view.

The company is offering a sneak peek at CES 2026 – the full reveal will have to wait for the MWC.\n\nIn case you missed it somehow, the Robot Phone has a unique gimbal mechanism that flips out of the back. Here you can see it retracted (left) and extended (right).\n\n\n\n\nThe Honor Robot Phone extending its camera gimbal\n\nNote that the first step of this process is for the protective panel to slide out of the way to the right.

A new rumor out of China today 'confirms' (as much as any rumor can) the fact that it will boast a 6.1-inch screen with a 60Hz refresh rate and the Dynamic Island feature (which also implies a hole-punch cutout replacing the iPhone 16e's notch), and a downgraded version of the Apple A19 chip that also powers the iPhone 17.\n\nIt will of course be the cheapest in the iPhone 17 family. These details have been rumored before, but even though nothing is official, the more rumors agree on stuff like this, the...</p>",
