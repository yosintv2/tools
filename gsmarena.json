As always, this has resulted in the device being listed in the benchmark's online database.\n\nThe phone has the model number LDY-AN00. It managed a single-core score of 2,969 and a multi-core score of 9,892, though as usual we have to caution you against taking such results from prototypes too seriously.\n\n\n\nThe handset runs Android 16, and it's powered by the Dimensity 9500 SoC paired with 16GB of RAM (though of course more memory options could be offered).\n\nHonor has...</p>",

Where they differ is in the storage - 128GB for the G, 64GB for the G Play; the charging speed is 30W on the Moto G (2026) and 18W on the Play (2026).\n\nYou also get better cameras on the Moto G (2026) - 50MP main vs 32MP, a second 2MP macro, and a high-res 32MP selfie vs 8MP on the Moto G Play (2026).\n\n\n\nThe...</p>",

According to preliminary data shared by Omdia, Apple was the runaway leader in terms of shipments and reached a record 25% market share. That means 1 in every 4 phones shipped in the last three months of 2025 was an iPhone.\n\n\n\nThat’s not particularly surprising as demand for the iPhone 17 series has remained strong since its launch in September. The holiday period also saw continued traction from older iPhone models like the 16 series, but it was the base iPhone 17 that...</p>",
