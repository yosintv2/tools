This will, however, thankfully change soon, as the company has now revealed when we should expect Android 16 to roll out to the Edge 50 Neo.\n\n[#InlinePriceWidget,13224,1#]\n\nIt will happen by the end of January, so there are only a few weeks left to wait, at most. The information comes from Motorola India, replying to a user on Reddit about the update situation for the Edge 50 Neo.\n\n\n\nMotorola launched the Edge 50 Neo in August 2024, running Android 14.

The brand is one of the few available in the US outside of the Apple-Google-Samsung trinity and shouldn’t be overlooked, even when it doesn’t get things 100% right.\n\nMotorola’s mostly clean Android implementation and the advanced connectivity features (even on some lower-end models) add to what are already some of the better value-for-money phones on the market.\n\nWinners: Motorola Razr series\n\nThe Razr 60 series – or as it is known in the US,...</p>",
