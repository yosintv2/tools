According to recently surfaced court documents from the US vs. Google antitrust case obtained by The Verge, Google is planning to phase out ChromeOS completely by 2034.\n\nWhy that year specifically? Well, Google’s last major ChromeOS hardware platform release was in 2023 and that means it will have to honor its ten-year support obligation through 2033-2034.\n\nThe new development comes from a transcript from the case where Google lawyers confirmed that their client was looking...</p>",

The few press renders come courtesy of Evan Blass and seemingly show the Pixel 10a in Lavender, one of the new colors.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, solid leaks suggest that the Pixel 10a will come in Lavender, Obsidian, Berry, and Fog. Those are different from the Iris, Obsidian, Peony, and Porcelain of the Pixel 9a.\n\nColors aside, the Pixel 10a will be nearly indistinguishable from the 9a. It's said to pack the same Tensor G4 as the 9a, and not the G5 in the Pixel 10.\n\nThe Tensor G4 is packaged with 8GB of RAM,...</p>",

Xiaomi described it as a research project, so its future was uncertain. However, Digital Chat Station now reports that this device is going into mass production and will be available commercially early this year (exact date is to be determined).\n\nIn case you missed it, this is a detachable camera module with a 100MP micro four-thirds sensor with a 35mm f/1.4-f/11 lens and a manual focus ring. The sensor offers native 2x zoom with pixel binning.\n\nWhat sets this apart from previous...</p>",
