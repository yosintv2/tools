Compact flagship-style phones don't do too well on the market, but we still love them.\n\nOurs is the Dusk Brown model, and it looks classy. There's something Audi A6 Allroad about it, minus the grey plastic mudguards. Nearly the entire...</p>",

The last time Samsung produced Qualcomm-designed chips was in 2022, when the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 came out, but it was met with a lot of criticism for its thermal issues. Moreover, the Korean tech giant's foundry didn't meet Qualcomm's requirements in terms of yield, so the US chip designer turned to...</p>",

But ever wondered what's inside, especially with the built-in subwoofer? Well, the guys at PBKreviews have done a complete teardown showing off the internals, and there are some interesting findings.\n\n\n\nLet's start with repairability. Previous Poco F generations have been criticized for being hard to repair, but the F8 Ultra appears to have improved on that aspect. Still, it's not the easiest phone repair, especially with the stacked components and plenty of adhesive.\n\nBuild...</p>",
