It comes with a peak brightness of 430 ISO lumens, which isn't much - basically fine for a dark room but won't let you see a lot if there's ambient lighting around.\n\nThat said, it is almost twice as bright as Samsung's previous generation, so there's that. The Freestyle+ has a 180-degree rotating design which supports projection at virtually any angle, including onto walls, ceilings, and even floors, without any additional accessories being required.\n\n\n\nIt boasts a built-in 360-degree speaker, \"tuned...</p>",

They are both powered by the recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 SoC, so forgive us for assuming they might actually end up being the same device sold under two different names in different markets (just like the X70 Air is the Edge 70).\n\nToday the X70 Air Pro has been certified for sale in China by TENAA, and the listing has confirmed the use of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 SoC. The phone obviously supports 5G, and measures 162.1 x 76.4 x 7 mm, weighing 187g.\n\n\nMotorola...</p>",

However, there are always those phones that just work for me for one reason or another.\n\nXiaomi 15 Ultra\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise for my colleagues that I'm picking the current Xiaomi Ultra for yet another year. I chose this phone for my daily driver mainly due to its versatile camera hardware. It has all the focal lengths I need, and the 4.2x telephoto camera uses a large 200MP sensor that allows for further cropping without sacrificing...</p>",
