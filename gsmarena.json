That one is still on pre-order, but you can already see it in stores.\n\nThe Motorola Signature with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage costs €1,000. It’s a slender 7mm phone that is fairly light at 186g without compromising the battery – 5,200mAh is more than you get from Samsung, Apple and Google, though not as much as Chinese brands are offering. The phone has a large 50MP sensor in the main camera (1/1.28” LYT-828), a 50MP 3x/71mm telephoto, 50MP...</p>",

Hence, the brand is now teasing an upcoming smartphone that also has a display on the back, integrated into a big camera island.\n\n\n\nThis being Lava, we expect the phone to be a mid-ranger, which explains the much smaller screen compared to Xiaomi's flagships. We can also see two rear cameras, of which the main one has 50MP resolution according to the inscription.\n\nNo other details are known about the device yet, only that it's coming soon. Undoubtedly, Lava will tease it some...</p>",

This one will be wider, just like the iPhone Fold, which is most likely being announced in September as well.\n\n\nOppo Find N5\n\nThe Find N7 will otherwise retain the core DNA of the Find N6, offering similar specs in a wider package, one that presumably will unfold into landscape mode like the iPhone...</p>",

This is obviously coming soon, since it's been added to this list, and like all of the M-series devices, it's a rebranded A-series model. But which exact one may surprise you.\n\nIt is in fact a rebranded A07 5G. Even the model number sort of confirms this, as it's SM-M076B. The codename adds further proof: \"a07x\".\n\n\n\nNothing else is known about the M17e at the moment, but the Galaxy A07 5G is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 SoC, paired with 8GB of RAM, so we wouldn't be at all...</p>",
