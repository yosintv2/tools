That one is still on pre-order, but you can already see it in stores.\n\nThe Motorola Signature with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage costs €1,000. It’s a slender 7mm phone that is fairly light at 186g without compromising the battery – 5,200mAh is more than you get from Samsung, Apple and Google, though not as much as Chinese brands are offering. The phone has a large 50MP sensor in the main camera (1/1.28” LYT-828), a 50MP 3x/71mm telephoto, 50MP...</p>",

The phone allegedly comes with a 6.85-inch screen, the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, up to 24GB of RAM, and a 7,000 mAh battery with support for 120W wired charging.\n\n\n\nIt measures 163.82 x 76.54 x 7.85mm and weighs 207g. It has an active cooling fan built-in, and an under-display selfie camera too. The RedMagic 11 Air was recently spotted on Geekbench, and this revealed that it will launch running Android 16 from day one.\n\nSource (in Chinese)\n</p>",

We got to spend some face time with all three, though note that there are some regional variations in naming. Globally, they are known as the Reno15, Reno15 Pro and Reno15 Pro Max.\n\nWhat we have here is the vanilla model, the Oppo Reno15, which is in the middle in terms of size – it has a 6.59” display, which is bigger than the 6.32” Pro/Pro Mini display, but smaller than the 6.78” Pro Max display. The battery, however, is the same size as the Max with 6,500mAh capacity.\n\n\nThe Reno15 family: Reno15...</p>",
