Compact flagship-style phones don't do too well on the market, but we still love them.\n\nOurs is the Dusk Brown model, and it looks classy.

The last time Samsung produced Qualcomm-designed chips was in 2022, when the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 came out, but it was met with a lot of criticism for its thermal issues.
